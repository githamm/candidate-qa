<h3 class="name">Denver City Council District 2: Suburban slice looks to stay
the course</h3>
<img class="district-map" src="images/district-2-map.jpg">
<p class="modal-text"><strong>By Kieran Nicholson</strong><br>
<em>The Denver Post</em></p>
<p>Denver's City Council District 2, in the southwest corner of the city, is
known for its relatively affordable housing and a suburban feel.</p>
<p>It also has been a rarity in left-leaning Denver, electing a series of
conservative council members.</p>
<p>Voters on May 5 will decide whether to follow that course in choosing one of
five candidates to succeed three-term Councilwoman Jeanne Faatz, who is
term-limited.</p>
<p>"Historically, the district has been somewhat of an outlier in Denver
politics," Eric Sondermann, an independent political analyst, said of the
predominately working-class district. "It has been far more conservative than
other parts of the city, almost quasi-suburban."</p>
<p>Ben Blanchard, president of the Bear Valley Improvement Association, a
50-year-old-plus community group that encompasses about 1,500 homes, said the
district mostly just needs the city's help with nuts-and-bolts issues.</p>
<p>"The city hasn't focused on upgrading things like sidewalks," Blanchard
said. "They're sinking and cracking here."</p>

&bull; March 26</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="name">Kevin Flynn</h3>
<p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
<p class="answer">I am running because I have the experience the position
requires to provide leadership, perspective and institutional memory to a City
Council that will have at least six new members. I was a reporter at the Rocky
Mountain News from 1981 until the day it closed in 2009. I was the paper’s City
Hall reporter and budget-finance expert for most of those years. Not only will
I ask the tough questions; as a member of the Denver Press Club Hall of Fame, I
have the demonstrated skills to ask the RIGHT questions. As a City Council
member, I will continue District 2’s tradition of fiscal discipline and fierce
independence. District 2 has the reputation of sending budget hawks to the
council, and by background and experience, I will be that person on the next
council. Retired City Council staff director John Bennett said of me: “Kevin
knew more about the city government than the people who were running it.” That
is why I have been endorsed by Doris Hackworth, wife of our late Councilman Ted
Hackworth, retired Police Chief Ari Zavaras, retired Safety Manager John
Simonet, as well as seven former City Council members including Cathy Reynolds,
Ed Thomas and Cathy Donohue. I am the only candidate to spell out specific
actions I intend to take to implement my platform of increased public safety,
better economic growth and improved quality of life. They are spelled out on my
website, <a href="http://www.flynnforcouncil.com/">FlynnForCouncil.com</a>.</p>
<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and
what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
<p class="answer">The most pressing issue is public safety. Auditor Dennis
Gallagher released an audit last year of response times in all six police
districts. The one covering southwest Denver had the longest average response
times in the city, growing from 12 minutes in 2008 to 16 minutes in 2013. It is
due mostly to the loss of 225 officers to retirement and other departures
following the Great Recession, when the city couldn’t afford to pay for new
police recruits. The geography of southwest Denver also delays response; there
are so few through-routes that officers sometimes have to cut through the city
of Littleton to get to the southern part of the district. The police commander
has instituted some tactical changes that have started to bring that average
down. But with city revenues growing again and police academy classes back on,
the most effective solution is to assign more of the new officers to southwest
Denver. I want to reduce the average response time by at least 25 percent, in
line with the rest of the city. This is outlined on my website at <a href=
"http://www.flynnforcouncil.com/issues">FlynnForCouncil.com/issues</a>.</p>
<p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you
would work on as a council member.</p>
<p class="answer">We need improvement in quality-of-life services. Some of our
long-time residents have told me they have seen a gradual decline in such
things as street and park maintenance – cuts that were made in the recession,
but which should be restored as basic city services. My wife and I knocked on
the door of a woman who has lived next to Sanderson Gulch for 35 years, and who
has been to Denver Health three times for severe allergic reactions to the
invasive weeds growing in the gulch since the city stopped mowing the banks.
Another 40-year resident of Mar Lee whom we met said she was told she should
move to a better ZIP Code if she expected more. That is unacceptable. In
southwest Denver, we don’t move to better ZIP Codes; we make our ZIP Codes
better.</p>
<p class="answer">The final issue is better economic growth in Council District
2. The economy is growing again and southwest Denver hasn’t fully taken
advantage. There are several modest redevelopment opportunities in our
commercial areas, especially at Sheridan and Evans, which has the potential to
be a vibrant mixed-use district. It’s a very challenging task but it can be a
great improvement to the district. It can be the seed bed for new locally owned
small businesses and employment, an arts center or any number of
pedestrian-oriented attractions.</p>
<p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased
traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges
associated with new development?</p>
<p class="answer">The 2000 Comprehensive Plan envisioned a city that values
sustainability and livability for all of its residents. New development and
density should be focused on areas where we are investing billions of dollars
expanding rail mass transit and mobility options, and on the Areas of Change
outlined in Blueprint Denver. There are great opportunities there to expand
affordable housing, and to meet the demand for new housing that we are
currently missing. I would focus on reinforcing the Areas of Stability outlined
in the Blueprint through maintenance and improvement of city infrastructure,
which encourages private investment by homeowners. I will ensure that
neighborhood input is obtained early in the development process in order to
identify contentious issues and work toward resolution. The city should work
closely with RTD to identify more transit options to serve new development, and
investigate opportunities for alternative mobility including expansion of
car-sharing and Denver B-cycle to other areas of the city.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on
two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing
restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should
Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
<p class="answer">The city already is taking steps that I believe are
innovative and hold promise. It has identified several hundred chronic homeless
and transient people on the streets of Denver who have been cycling in and out
of various city services. This core population is responsible for more than $11
million per year in social service costs borne by the city. Getting most if not
all of them into mental health, substance abuse or residential treatment
programs may crack the core of the problem – a tipping point, hopefully, in
easing the burden on the streets. This strategy is innovative and reflects my
position that targeting the core will help ease the problem at the margins. I
support the efforts of private, nonprofit and public entities that are working
to ensure that when a homeless person sleeping in a park or in a business
doorway is asked to “move along,” there is a place to which they can actually
move other than the next park or doorway down the line, one that might offer
diversion and treatment.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of
red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
<p class="answer">I differentiate between red light cameras and speeding
cameras. Photo radar to enforce speed limits in residential areas, school zones
and parks is effective and should continue. Red light cameras are not. I don’t
want to photograph traffic accidents, I want to prevent them, and proper
traffic engineering will do that. Traffic engineers know that red light running
can be virtually eliminated through proper timing of the yellow light. Fort
Collins added one second more yellow time at a camera intersection in 2005, and
saw less than one driver per day running that red light. But until 2009, Denver
used the legal minimum of just three seconds of yellow, which is too short for
traffic moving faster than 30 mph. After I reported this in the Rocky Mountain
News, Denver’s traffic engineers did a blind test. They took video at four busy
intersections with three-second yellow lights and counted numerous red light
violations. Then they added a half-second or so to the yellow light and took
more video. The result was the near-elimination of red-light running. Based on
that, Denver has lengthened yellow lights all around the city. If Denver
identifies problem intersections and installs red light cameras instead of
taking proven traffic engineering countermeasures, it is knowingly maintaining
an unsafe condition.</p>
<p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will
increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year
later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
<p class="answer">I was the first candidate to come out in firm opposition to
the raise. I issued a press release against it that was covered by the Denver
Post and Westword. The previous salary was more than sufficient, in my opinion,
and I personally lobbied several council members against it. But in the end, it
passed and is the new salary level. I won’t work for less pay than my
colleagues, so I will accept it – just as past and current council members who
opposed pay raises accepted them if they passed. But what I will also do is
take the lead on the council to identify a more politically palatable way to
set council salaries every four years. Otherwise, I commit right now to voting
“no” on the next raise discussion in four years.</p>
<p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has
implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
<p class="answer">The emphasis on community policing has had success, and I
have spoken with officers who believe they are getting better results. But
there is much more to be done internally. There appears to be a disconnect
between the chief and the rank-and-file that needs to be addressed. Chief White
has been doing a great job in connecting with the community, and I would advise
him to do more to connect with the officers.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges,
including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing
problems in jail management?</p>
<p class="answer">On the council, I will work with the mayoral administration
to implement the recommendations in Auditor Dennis Gallagher’s recent report
that detailed mismanagement, understaffing and delays in analyzing data that
could more quickly resolve problems. The council will play a major role in
fixing problems at the jail if it requires new operating expenditures to ensure
adequate staffing levels are met, or capital expenditures to make physical
changes that may be required to ensure the sheriff’s deputies can conduct their
duties safely and responsibly. In addition, the council can and should have a
consulting role with the administration in addressing management issues.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the
National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not,
what other options should the city pursue?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes. Voter approval is required in order to authorize a
renewal of lodging and car rental taxes that are scheduled to expire, and I
would favor that for two reasons. First, it does not change the tax rate, it
simply extends the current rate. Second, the tax is paid for the most part by
visitors and tourists who are choosing to come to Denver. And it would not be
an increase for them either, since it is the existing rate. The comprehensive
plan to revamp the National Western Center, reconnect neighborhoods, open up
the South Platte River to the people and leverage RTD’s construction of a rail
transit station there is important to the revitalization of Globeville, Swansea
and Elyria.</p>
<p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest
strength and greatest weakness?</p>
<p class="answer">His greatest strength is his genuine care and concern for
people. I was fortunate to witness this personally. Passionate concern for
people as individuals is one of the most important traits for a public servant
to possess. His greatest weakness is allowing his schedule to become so busy
that he hasn’t had time to become familiar with some of the pressing issues in
my southwest Denver district. I will ensure that he hears about our needs in
District 2.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted
collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment
system?</p>
<p class="answer">I support the Career Service system because I believe it has
worked well. Any change would have to be approved by voters, and several times
in the past, voters have rejected charter proposals for collective bargaining
that were referred to the ballot by the council. If workers pursue collective
bargaining, I believe they should approach it through a ballot initiative.</p>
<p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana
working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
<p class="answer">They are working for the most part, but one area that is
costing us more than it should is in the area of licenses and inspections. I
would propose that locations holding multiple licenses have the option of
renewing all at the same time, so that required city inspections can be
conducted during one visit rather than having inspectors visit the location
multiple times.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either
fully or with restrictions?</p>
<p class="answer">No. Amendment 64 specifically prohibits public consumption.
The state constitution would have to be amended again to allow it.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th
Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
<p class="answer">No.</p>
<p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change
current spending priorities for city services?</p>
<p class="answer">With all of the attention that is drawn by large projects, I
would like to see some additional priority on spending for small projects. For
example, while campaigning I visited the home of an Iraq War veteran who uses
an electric wheelchair to get around. But the house where his family raised him
is on a street that has no sidewalk, curb, gutter or drainage. It has just a
gravel shoulder – in the middle of the city. When there is snow or ice along
the road, he can’t make it three blocks to the bus stop. This veteran shouldn’t
have to move from his family’s home to be able to get around. Another example
of needed small projects: Many District 2 residents have complained about
speeding through the neighborhood. Periodic stepped-up enforcement can produce
stop-gap improvements. But based on my transportation experience, I know that
drivers naturally go faster when the road invites it. Wide streets produce
higher speeds. Small projects such as bulb-outs, widened sidewalks or
designated bike lanes that narrow the roadway can reduce speeds.</p>

Denver City Council District 2: Suburban slice looks to stay the course</a>
&bull; March 26</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="name">John Kidd</h3>
<p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
<p class="answer">I’m running for City Council because I believe the people in
my district need a person with my skills and abilities to represent them and be
their voice of reason on the council regarding issues important to them. As a
business professional with over 23 years’ experience in accounting, auditing,
insurance, and information technology with several Fortune 500 companies, I
have the necessary skills and experience needed to identify efficiencies and
cost savings that can free up money for basic city services. I currently serve
my community as Treasurer and Board Member of two homeowner’s associations. I
work with fellow board members to keep our Southwest Denver community vibrant
and most importantly, financially sound. I recently earned the endorsement of
District 2 Councilwoman Jeanne Faatz because of my civic and charitable service
to the community and the commitment I’ve made to represent the citizens of
Southwest Denver with honesty, transparency, and accountability.</p>
<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and
what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
<p class="answer">Public Safety - As a council member, I would work with
representatives of public safety to improve response times and to make sure the
fine men and women who serve our community have the necessary resources they
need to do their job safely and effectively. According to City Auditor Dennis
Gallagher’s report on response times, our district has one of the slowest
response times (over 16 ½ minutes from 911 Dispatch to arriving on the scene)
in Denver. This is a matter of not having enough officers and resources to
patrol all the areas of a very large, geographically challenging district. The
extreme southern part of District 2 is situated between Jefferson and Arapaho
counties, the cities of Lakewood, Littleton, and Denver along with some rather
unique boundary lines which complicate the determination of jurisdiction at the
time of the 911 call. I would also support increased efforts to enlist the help
of citizens in crime prevention through the Denver Police Department Volunteers
In Police Service Program (VIPS) and promote neighborhood watch programs.</p>
<p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you
would work on as a council member.</p>
<p class="answer">Affordable housing is a major issue for Downtown Denver and
also in District 2. We’ve seen unprecedented demand for housing over the past
several years as Denver’s housing market has bounced back at a rather
astonishing rate. From the Denver Metro Association of Realtors March 2015
report, over the past year, we’ve seen single family housing prices increase by
over 19% and condo prices by almost 7% as available inventory has dropped to
record lows. I’ll work with other members on the council to continue efforts to
create more affordable housing options through existing programs available from
the Denver Housing Authority and Federal Housing and Urban Development programs
that provide block grants to assist residents of growing cities like Denver
find affordable housing or assistance with housing expense.</p>
<p class="answer">Code Enforcement – In order to keep our neighborhoods
beautiful and vibrant, I’ll make sure the existing zoning codes are enforced
and work to create a volunteer-based blight remediation program that assists
those with special needs or circumstances that cannot maintain their property
without help. In my opinion, that’s what good neighbors do by helping each
other out in times of need.</p>
<p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased
traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges
associated with new development?</p>
<p class="answer">People are moving to Denver in record numbers to enjoy the
many great benefits our wonderful city has to offer. With unemployment at a
record low 4% and a strong demand for highly skilled, highly educated workers,
Denver is attracting the best and brightest from all over the country and even
the world. The new developments that are in the process of being built right
now are barely enough to keep up with the surge of people currently relocating
to Denver. That’s why it is very important for city government to manage growth
in order to deal with uncontrolled urban sprawl, high density housing issues,
and, of course, transportation and infrastructure overload. As detailed in the
Blueprint Denver transportation and land use plan, the city must follow this
comprehensive plan in order to grow the city in a “balanced”, responsible
manner with a focus on livability and improving the quality of life for not
just a select group of people, but for all the residents of Denver. We are
seeing the fundamental change from traditional tract home neighborhoods like
Stapleton, Globeville, Elyria, and Swansea in areas of growth to Transit
Oriented Developments (TOD’s). Our challenge as a city is to make sure we are
doing this in a manner that doesn’t overburden the taxpayers, overextend the
city’s credit, or simply get in the mode of trying to do too much too fast.
Smart growth through proper planning is the way to go in my opinion.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on
two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing
restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should
Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
<p class="answer">I applaud the efforts of the Denver Business Improvement
District and the Downtown Denver Partnership in supporting the many faith-based
initiatives that are working to make Downtown Denver safer and also efforts by
individuals to guide those seeking assistance to the many available Downtown
centers and resources for the homeless. In my opinion, the City Council should
continue to support efforts like the Lawrence Street Community Center and the
St. Francis Center outreach to help those truly seeking assistance. For those
who have no desire for help, the Council needs to support the efforts of law
enforcement to keep Downtown Denver safe for tourists and residents and support
full enforcement of the unpopular camping ban.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of
red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
<p class="answer">I do support the use of red-light cameras at intersections
where drivers just blow right through the red light without any regard to
safety. Intersections where these cameras are installed should be clearly
identifiable with signs that alert drivers that photo red-light cameras are in
use and should have extended times for yellow lights and also some type of
countdown mechanism to alert a drive as to how much time they have before the
light turns red. This would help prevent some of the rear-end collisions
happening when drivers slam on the brakes in fear of getting a ticket. My major
concern with the red-light ticketing process is that tickets are being issued
to drivers for just going past the white line. I feel that during the review of
white line violations, the technician should only ticket drivers who have
driven past the white line into the cross walk only when pedestrians are
present.</p>
<p class="answer">I do support the use of photo radar on neighborhood side
streets where children are present, construction zones, school zones, and areas
where excessive speeding is an issue. I would not support the expansion of
red-light cameras and photo radar because I believe Denver currently has an
appropriate amount of equipment in place to help reduce vehicle and pedestrian
accidents at troublesome intersections from red light violations and slowing
down driving speeds in high risk areas.</p>
<p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will
increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year
later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
<p class="answer">On January 13th this year, of the over 50 municipal
candidates for office at that time, I was the only candidate who attended the
City Council Finance and Services Committee meeting and spoke out in opposition
of the 10.3% raise. I opposed this raise simply because the council had just
received a 6 % raise over the past two years (3 % in 2013 and another 3% in
2014). I opposed the 10.3% raise because in my opinion, even though members of
the council had full authority to approve the full salary increase, it just
reinforced a perception by the public that government is not living within its
means. This was the council’s opportunity to show the voters they’re concerned
with controlling the cost of city government. I will not take this raise
because I personally believe a 10% pay increase is out of line with salaries in
other comparable municipalities and does not reflect typical private sector
salary increases in Denver. As I stated in my public testimony, once elected, I
will not accept the salary increase and would give the difference to a charity
or charities of my choosing within my district or simply return it to the
General Fund.</p>
<p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has
implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
<p class="answer">I support public safety and have the utmost respect for the
men and women of Denver’s law enforcement. I believe that some of the reforms
Chief White has implemented are good, but some have had unintended
consequences. His requirement that officers wear body cameras is a step in the
right direction along with enforcing disciplinary action for officer
falsehoods. His team concept provides better supervision but requires more
officers than are currently available, and unfortunately, will not be available
any time soon as we lose more officers to retirement and attrition. His
decision to flatten the organizational structure by eliminating the rank of
captain sounded good initially but was more than offset by the addition of more
commander positions. Officer morale is at an all-time low after the Chief’s
decision to allow the desecration of the fallen officer’s memorial. I feel the
Chief needs to make amends with not only the officers, but also with restoring
confidence in the public that lawless acts will not be allowed to happen
without intervention by law enforcement.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges,
including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing
problems in jail management?</p>
<p class="answer">The City Auditors Office headed by Auditor Dennis Gallagher
just recently released on March 19th, 2015 a very alarming audit of the Denver
Sheriff’s Department management of the Denver jail. From the audit, Auditor
Gallagher stated “DSD’s management of jail operations has been poor, harming
the City’s reputation, increasing risk to sheriff deputies and inmates, and
wasting taxpayer resources.” In my opinion, the Denver voters were sold a bad
bill of goods when we were asked to approve the funding for the new jail. The
promise made to us was that the new jail would save the taxpayers money by
streamline the incarceration process and reducing the number of personnel
needed to operate the jail. To date, there are major concerns with spending for
overtime and severe issues with the safety of deputies and inmates that raise
more questions than answers. The jail has many blind spots that are extreme
safety issues and need to be fixed now. I understand that in May, hired
consultants will present their initial recommendations in solving the jail
crisis. I feel the council should take steps now to address some of the audit
recommendations to improve jail management and approve funding for additional
personnel to alleviate understaffing.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the
National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not,
what other options should the city pursue?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes. The National Western Center plan includes not just the
stock show but many other attractions for year-round use. Colorado State
University and the Museum of Nature and Science are just two of the partners in
this project. I feel it is a perfect use of taxes paid primarily by tourists
through lodging and car rental taxes.</p>
<p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest
strength and greatest weakness?</p>
<p class="answer">As Vice-President of Turnabout, Inc. a jobs program for
non-violent first time offenders, I first met Mayor Michael Hancock when he was
a city councilman at a church in South Denver where we both attended a
community forum to address homelessness and ways to reduce recidivism at the
Denver County Jail. The Mayor greatest strength is that he is a very likable
person who is open to public input and makes himself extremely accessible to
the people of Denver. In my opinion, the Mayor’s greatest weakness is his
inability to appoint top–level Public Safety Officials, specifically, the last
two Denver Sheriffs as this department is in desperate need of a highly
qualified, strong leader to get the department back on track.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted
collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment
system?</p>
<p class="answer">I do not believe that Denver’s civil service employees need
to have collective bargaining rights simply because they have an excellent
employment system in place. The Office of Human Resources (formerly Career
Services Authority) does an excellent job protecting civil service employees
rights, providing exceptional compensation and benefits, and hiring and
promoting employees based upon a competitive merit process.</p>
<p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana
working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
<p class="answer">I do believe that Denver’s regulation on the sale of
recreational marijuana for the most part is working. The areas of concern that
have been identified like unlicensed grow facilities and unlicensed sales are
being ferreted out and shut down by the FBI, DEA, and local law enforcement
through sting operations.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either
fully or with restrictions?</p>
<p class="answer">Amendment 64 specifically prohibits the public consumption of
marijuana. I support the intended will of the voters who approved Amendment 64
and feel that public consumption of marijuana should not be allowed due to
concerns with public safety, health and welfare.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th
Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes, I believe there should be a tobacco ban on the 16th
Street Mall mainly because this is a pedestrian mall used by many families with
small children and those with respiratory issues who are adversely affected by
second hand smoke. Additionally, I would support a smoking ban on the Mall due
to the many restaurants with open air seating for patrons who are also affected
by second-hand smoke from smokers at tables next to them or from smokers
walking along the mall.</p>
<p class="answer">In regards to city parks, I don’t believe it’s necessary to
impose a smoking ban simply because of the inherent openness of the park.
Unlike city streets where there is no option to avoid a person who is smoking
in front of you as you are walking or smoking as you walk by them, at least in
a park you have the option to go to an area where there are no smokers if you
prefer.</p>
<p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change
current spending priorities for city services?</p>
<p class="answer">I believe there should be more emphasis on fully funding
basic city services first and foremost. The diversion of monies from the
general fund to special projects or other purposes has to stop. Additionally,
street maintenance, additional lane miles paved, and increased public safety
funding for more police officers were promises made to the voters with the
passage of Measure 2A in 2012. Unfortunately, Denver’s streets are in need of
serious repair and repaving and the Denver Police Department is still dealing
with not having enough new officers graduating from the Police Academy to
replace those officers retiring or from attrition.</p>

<p>The South Platte River splits south Denver's City Council District 7 nearly
down the middle, but its halves are hardly mirror images.</p>
<p>In the eastern part, neighborhoods including Baker and Platt Park thrive but
face redevelopment pressures and surging housing costs. Neighbors of vibrant
commercial and entertainment districts — and the city's largest concentration
of pot shops, on Broadway — are dealing with traffic congestion and parking
crunches.</p>
<p>But travel west across the South Platte River and the picture is different,
the needs of the neighborhoods more fundamental.</p>
<p>Residents of working-class Athmar Park and Ruby Hill drive over pockmarked
streets, walk on sidewalks that stop short and want nicer city services,
including better recreation centers. Light-rail stations aren't far away — but
crossing the river or Santa Fe Drive is tricky without a car.</p>
<p>Along the redrawn district's western border, Federal Boulevard offers empty
lots and blighted properties that could be prime for new uses, if investors had
interest.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="name">Aaron Greco</h3>
<p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
<p class="answer">I’m running for City Council because I want my daughter,
Rosemary, and her peers to grow up in a diverse, sustainable, and dynamic city.
The City Council plays an important role in shaping Denver’s neighborhoods into
vibrant areas with multimodal transportation access, universally accessible
parks and recreation, thriving artistic and cultural resources, and bustling
local business districts. I want to put my diverse experience in collaborating
with communities across the state at every level of government to work for the
benefit of all of Denver’s citizens.</p>
<p class="answer">As an aide to two U.S. Representatives from Colorado – Ed
Perlmutter & John Salazar – I’ve worked across the state and in Washington to
encourage partnerships, unify community voices, and develop policies to
increase investments in public infrastructure, while preserving our most
precious resources. Today, as a transportation professional, I work with
Colorado communities to develop bicycle and pedestrian projects, road and
bridge projects, and create greater access to a more robust public transit
system.</p>
<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and
what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
<p class="answer">Like most working families, young professionals, and
millennials in Council District 7, our family is faced with the challenge of
rising home prices and cost of living in Denver. We never thought we’d face the
possibility of being priced out of our neighborhood – my wife, Tessa, and I
both have great jobs – but with challenges like student loan debt, the rising
cost of day care, and a crisis with housing affordability in Denver, families
just like ours are looking at other options.</p>
<p class="answer">The next City Council has the opportunity to make Denver
great for generations to come. To ensure that Denver’s students, professionals,
and seniors can continue living in in the city we love, we must tackle a
variety of issues with forward-thinking and fiscally responsible policies. As a
member of the City Council, I’ll collaborate with my colleagues and the
administration to grow the supply and diversity of affordable and attainable
housing options in Denver while maintaining the character of our unique
neighborhoods. That means taking carefully considered action to encourage
responsible density and an interconnected, multimodal transportation system
that minimizes the additional strain on our congested roadways.</p>
<p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you
would work on as a council member.</p>
<p class="answer">District 7 has unique challenges with an interstate, a river,
and several North-South arterials dividing communities. Neighborhoods like Ruby
Hill and Athmar Park are in close proximity to transit hubs, but have no easy
way to connect with those hubs outside of an automobile. Neighborhoods like
Platt Park, Baker, West Wash Park, and Overland can’t access the South Platte
River Trail safely. Any new developments along the South Platte corridor must
include incentives for connectivity upgrades and investments. This can be done
through a variety of means. We need a leader who will promote partnerships
between multiple government jurisdictions and the private sector to achieve
greater multimodal connectivity in Council District 7.</p>
<p class="answer">Transit-oriented, multi-use density has to be promoted in
areas like the former Gates Factory location, the Shattuck superfund site, the
former RTD bus barn location, and other areas adjacent to light rail. These
kinds of developments have the least impact on parking and congestion and are
largely located in former industrial or light-industrial areas. In order to
accommodate growth responsibly we’ll need to promote these areas for
redevelopment.</p>
<p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased
traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges
associated with new development?</p>
<p class="answer">We are not going to be able to build enough streets and
parking to get out from under congestion, let alone the increased traffic
volumes that come with growth. We also can’t pull up a drawbridge and ask
people to stay away from our city. Denver is inclusive and open, and it should
stay that way. First, we have to maintain the transportation system that we
have, which is no small feat. Corridors like Alameda west of I-25 are poorly
maintained. This is partially because older infrastructure is more expensive to
maintain and there are less partnership opportunities. Second, we have to make
critical investments in providing multimodal options outside of the automobile.
In the coming decades, it will ideally be more efficient to hop on a circulator
bus, a train, a bicycle, or sidewalk than it will be to fight congestion in our
cars.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on
two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing
restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should
Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
<p class="answer">I would not have supported the camping ban as passed in 2012.
Denver still lacks proper services and shelter space, although I applaud steps
taken through Denver’s Road Home and other programs supported by the Mayor to
address these needs. Giving someone seeking shelter a criminal record only
makes the problem worse. Supporting our most vulnerable populations with basic
services is a core function of government. I will explore the use of social
impact bonds and other available financing methods to deliver the housing,
addiction treatment, counseling, and training services that will bring Denver’s
indigent population out of the cold. This will reduce expenditures on emergency
room treatment and incarceration and save taxpayer money in the long run.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of
red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
<p class="answer">As a transportation policy professional for CDOT, I know all
too well how dangerous speeding is. For the safety of motorists, pedestrians,
and workers, I support photo radar in work zones and school zones only. I won’t
support any expansion of photo radar and won’t support expansion of red light
cameras unless a compelling need can be demonstrated. I do believe that red
light cameras are an enticement for revenue by some, but I disregard any
argument made in favor of expansion related to revenue alone.</p>
<p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will
increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year
later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
<p class="answer">Asking anyone to consider the merits of their paycheck in an
unbiased way is impossible. A new system of automatic pay review needs to be
implemented. The Career Services Authority Board, or another independent
entity, should examine raises for council members and the mayor in the same way
it does other city employees.</p>
<p class="answer">I’m running for a job that will pay an eventual annual salary
of $91,915. I will give a significant amount to charities that exist inside
District 7, and I won’t vote for any pay increase for council members unless
unbiased checks are placed on the process.</p>
<p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has
implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
<p class="answer">I have concerns about some of Chief White’s reform measures
like the “team approach”. Many rank-and-file cops feel that response time is
delayed and safety may be jeopardized. I was incredibly impressed, however,
with the implementation of body cameras, although I think work is needed to
ensure that the system works properly.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges,
including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing
problems in jail management?</p>
<p class="answer">There are a number of measures we can explore to address
issues at the jail that have resulted in a lack of safety for both inmates and
officers. Whether flaws exist in jail design, staffing levels, training, or
administration, reforms need to be made. If safety can be promoted through
reconfiguration or redesign of parts of the jail, I’ll be the first one to make
those recommendations, no matter the cost. I’m not interested in saving a
dollar to the detriment of public safety. Period.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the
National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not,
what other options should the city pursue?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes. The renovated and expanded National Western will be a
showcase that will bring visitors from across Colorado, the United States, and
the world. In a city with more than enough demand on its scarce tax dollars, I
think it’s justifiable that the very people who come to enjoy the National
Western shoulder some of the burden of paying to build it. As a newly elected
councilperson, however, I’d like to at least examine other uses for extended
lodging tax revenues.</p>
<p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest
strength and greatest weakness?</p>
<p class="answer">I believe that Mayor Hancock’s management style is very
effective. For a mayor with as much authority as Denver’s, the quality of
cabinet-level mayoral appointees is critical to implementing public priorities.
Having spoken with many of Denver’s staff, I know that Mayor Hancock’s deputies
enjoy working for him and are given what they need to succeed. I believe he has
recruited and retained a high-caliber cabinet that looks like Denver and shares
our values. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to work closely with him and
his administration.</p>
<p class="answer">I’ve been pleased with some progress in his public acceptance
of the cannabis industry but feel there is still some room for improvement. My
hope is that he’ll be open to many of the ideas the upcoming council must
consider regarding the differences between public and private consumption and
extending retail hours of operation.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted
collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment
system?</p>
<p class="answer">Collective bargaining is a legal and fundamental human right.
Municipal Employees should have access to collective bargaining if they are
united behind the desire to do so.</p>
<p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana
working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
<p class="answer">We still have a long way to go before Denver and Colorado
become the model for legalization across the U.S. That said, we’re off to a
good start. We need policies that yield a safe and consistent product for
consumers, a healthy business environment for producers, and an end to what
remains of the black market. I support the exploration of a plant count
ordinance and greater restrictions and monitoring of growing co-ops.
Additionally, better coordination between city departments is needed to
simplify regulatory compliance.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either
fully or with restrictions?</p>
<p class="answer">I believe that the overwhelming number of voters who
supported Amendment 64 were sold on a straightforward proposition: marijuana
should be regulated like alcohol. I think residents and visitors in Denver
should be allowed to consume marijuana in some kind of accommodation that
complies with indoor clean air rules and regulations. There’s simply no use in
allowing consumption by out-of-state residents without a legal option for them
to do so.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th
Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
<p class="answer">Before outright bans are even considered, better management
and enforcement policies should be put in place. My concern is that smoking
bans are sometimes used to address problems other than the effects of
second-hand smoke.</p>
<p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change
current spending priorities for city services?</p>
<p class="answer">Greater investments in Community Planning and Development and
the Office of Economic Development are needed to foster a robust planning
process and accommodate Denver’s unprecedented growth. A number of
transportation investments should be made inside of District 7 including bike
and pedestrian infrastructure spanning the South Platte River and a dedicated
bike lane on Broadway.</p>
<p class="answer">My candidacy for Denver City Council is motivated by a desire
to plan a city that that is inclusive, vibrant, safe and navigable. Any budget
priorities will reflect these values.</p>

Issues reflect entire city in race for south Denver District 7 City Council
seat</a> &bull; April 6</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="name">Jolon Clark</h3>
<p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
<p class="answer">I was born and raised in Denver, grew up in Wash Park, and
graduated from South High School. Now I live in Platt Park with my wife Sarah
who is a Denver Public School teacher, and my two kids who both attend our
neighborhood school, McKinley-Thatcher where I am currently the PTA
president.</p>
<p class="answer">For the past 18 years, I have worked for a nonprofit
organization called The Greenway Foundation. I have taken thousands of kids on
SPREE field trips to the South Platte River, and I have worked on public park
and trail projects including spearheading the vision for a 5.5 million dollar
park right in the heart of District 7 that will open in April of 2015 and will
be a premier outdoor learning park for kids.</p>
<p class="answer">In addition to my work at The Greenway Foundation, I am on
the board of directors for various community and nonprofit organizations
including my neighborhood organization and the Levitt Pavilion board where I
have worked to help bring a free cultural facility to District 7 at Ruby Hill
Park. This outdoor amphitheater will be completed next year and will provide 50
free concerts a year to our community.</p>
<p class="answer">What I have learned through my work in the community is how
to listen first, how to build a vision that everyone is excited about, and how
to get things done. I am excited to bring my 18 years of experience working on
public projects in Denver and in District 7 to the Denver City Council.</p>
<p class="answer">It takes a village to raise a child, and this community is
the village that raised me. I am running for Denver City Council because I am
passionate about giving back to this community that has given me so much. If
elected, I will work hard to make sure that we continue to build a city that is
safe, connected, and vibrant.</p>
<p class="answer">It would be a great honor for me to represent the community
where I grew up on Denver City Council.</p>
<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and
what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
<p class="answer">Managing Growth. Denver is forecast to continue to grow as
more and more people want to call this amazing city home. With this growth
comes added density. Managing this growth and density, and how it affects our
city and our historic neighborhoods, is a critical issue. We need to look at
how to grow responsibly, put density where density belongs, and make the
appropriate investments in parking and transportation infrastructure to ensure
that this growth adds to the vibrancy of our city and does not destroy the
historic charm of our neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you
would work on as a council member.</p>
<p class="answer">Transportation - Tied to this growth we also need to continue
to invest in a multimodal transportation system that improves the bike and
pedestrian infrastructure, looks for innovative solutions to the "last mile"
issue for mass transit commuters, and creates safe and practical alternatives
to moving through our city with a car. I would continue my work on getting a
new bike/ped bridge built over Santa Fe at Evans, and work with the developers
at the former Gates site and at the Broadway Marketplace to build better
connections between the east and west sides of District 7 at Mississippi and
Alameda.</p>
<p class="answer">Great Places to Live and Work - We need to strive for a city
where each and every resident has a safe place to live and work. This means
having streets that people feel safe walking or biking on, great schools in
every neighborhood, and affordable housing that is connected to places to shop
and to the workplace.</p>
<p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased
traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges
associated with new development?</p>
<p class="answer">We need to have an open and transparent process for handling
the traffic and parking issues that come with new development. Neighborhoods
need to have a voice in this process to make sure that this new development
doesn’t make our existing neighborhoods unlivable. This should be a
collaborative process where the developers and neighbors work to plan and build
our neighborhoods together. I believe that the process is always made better
when all of the stakeholders have a seat at the table. It is made better when
there is a leader who is committed to authentically listening and is focused on
what is best for our community as we grow. I will be that kind of leader for
District 7 on Denver City Council.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on
two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing
restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should
Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
<p class="answer">Studies have shown that not only is it safer and more
compassionate to get people off of the streets and into housing, but it also
costs less to provide this housing than the combined community cost of having
them out on the street. Denver should tackle this multifaceted issue on
multiple fronts. We should work hard to get individuals, including the
chronically homeless, into housing and off the streets. We need to explore
using social impact bonds as one method of accomplishing this while continuing
to partner with the private, philanthropic, and nonprofit sectors.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of
red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
<p class="answer">The end goal of technology and tools used for traffic
enforcement should be to create safe streets for motorists, pedestrians, and
bicyclists. We need to explore other options and alternatives for keeping our
streets safe that are less punitive. Cameras and photo speeding enforcement
should only be used when and where other alternatives have been proven to be
ineffective.</p>
<p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will
increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year
later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
<p class="answer">Right now I am focused on getting out into my community,
meeting with people, learning about their concerns, and sharing my story with
them. I am completely focused on my campaign and earning the support of my
community to represent them. If I am elected, I will sit down with my family to
look at the pay and benefits that the job provides and decide at that
point.</p>
<p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has
implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
<p class="answer">I think that there is always more work to be done when it
comes to keeping our city, our citizens, and our law enforcement officers all
safe. I think that we have made progress through many of the reforms that Chief
White has made, but that we need to constantly evaluate, learn, and adapt. Our
aim should be to have the best police department in the country, and achieving
that goal will require constant evaluation and reform where things are not
working.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges,
including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing
problems in jail management?</p>
<p class="answer">Council should exercise every power granted in the City
Charter to monitor, evaluate, and reform the culture and policies at the jail.
City Council should continue to push for transparency and empower the
independent monitor. We have to take any steps necessary to prevent this kind
of abuse from ever happening in our jail system.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the
National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not,
what other options should the city pursue?</p>
<p class="answer">I think that every option for funding should be explored for
a project the size and scope of the redevelopment of the National Western
Center. We need to build strong partnerships, engage the private sector, look
for grant funds from the public and philanthropic sectors, and examine existing
and new funding streams within the city to put this project together. I think
that extending the lodging and car rental taxes can be part of the mix, but
that we should work hard to raise and find as much money as possible so that
any tax increase is as minimal as possible.</p>
<p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest
strength and greatest weakness?</p>
<p class="answer">Mayor Hancock’s strength is his ability to think big and
paint a picture of a vision for what our city can be. I think that his weakness
has sometimes been in not engaging the community fully in all steps of the
process when implementing this vision.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted
collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment
system?</p>
<p class="answer">I believe that the current employment system for civil
service employees is working. If elected, I would talk with these employees
regularly to hear their concerns and work to make sure that Denver is always a
safe, fair, and respectful place to work. I think that we can continue to
address worker safety, retention, pay, and benefits without a collective
bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana
working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
<p class="answer">I think that for the large part, the regulations are working.
We do need, however, to take a close look at the rules, regulations, and
enforcement around co-ops and other non commercial growing operations to ensure
that the marijuana that is reaching consumers is safe, that we are keeping
product off of the black market and out of illegal distribution channels, and
that legal and regulated businesses in the industry are not being forced to
compete with illegal grows on an uneven playing field. I think we need to look
at the restrictions on growing in commercial space, and what licensing and
regulation requirements are required for co-ops to ensure that we limit illegal
activity as much as is possible.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either
fully or with restrictions?</p>
<p class="answer">I would explore allowing public consumption with
restrictions. I do not think we should allow for consumption in our parks or
public spaces. The current restrictions make it legal for visitors to purchase
marijuana, but provide very limited options for where they can legally consume
it. We have to create legal avenues to discourage and prevent illegal behavior.
Looking at options for public consumption at marijuana “bars” could help solve
this problem. It could also help in combatting the growth in currently illegal
short term rentals in the city by providing visitors who stay at hotels in
Denver somewhere legal to consume the marijuana they purchase here. Public
safety and keeping marijuana out of the hands of our children will always be my
top priorities. I think that we can create a safer environment than we
currently have in Denver by creating legal avenues for public consumption of
marijuana with appropriate restrictions.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th
Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
<p class="answer">The 16th Street Mall is a unique place in Denver that
functions as a contiguous outdoor public “living room” for all of Denver, and
our parks are our city’s backyard. Keeping our public spaces safe, clean, and
vibrant for all of the users is a high priority for me. Personally, I would
like to see these vibrant public spaces free of tobacco smoke, but I think that
a ban on smoking across all city parks should be a decision made by the voters,
like our statewide smoking ban in enclosed public spaces was.</p>
<p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change
current spending priorities for city services?</p>
<p class="answer">I would push more funding to safety, parks, and public
spaces. The quality of life in our city is dependent first and foremost on us
feeling safe in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and moving around our city.
Public spaces provide countless health and community benefits and create a city
that is vibrant and active. I would also push for a higher priority for bike
and pedestrian infrastructure as we work to build a truly walkable, bikeable,
and liveable city.</p>

<p class="modal-text"><strong>By Lynn Bartels</strong><br>
<em>The Denver Post</em></p>
<p>Colorado's state Capitol and Denver's City and County Building are among the
no table landmarks in a council district that feels the social impacts of being
in a big city.</p>
<p>During a forum for the five candidates who want to represent City Council
District 10, the first questions concerned a methadone clinic scheduled to open
on Colfax Avenue across from East High School, whether there is a need for
public toilets, and thoughts on a camping ban for the homeless.</p>
<p>"People have used my yard to relieve themselves," said candidate Chris
Chiari, who lives in Uptown.</p>
<p>The current councilwoman, Jeanne Robb, who is term-limited, said when her
daughter worked at the historic Molly Brown House Museum at 1340 Pennsylvania
St., the staff used to have to clean human waste off the porch in the
morning.</p>
<p>"I do think my district is a study in contrasts. It's also a 'tale of two
avenues,' " she said, referring to Colfax and First avenues.</p>
<p>One has a gritty reputation, the other a more gilded image.</p>

<h3 class="name">Wayne New</h3>
<p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
<p class="answer">For over 15 years I have been actively involved with city
issues and community development and zoning matters, promoting a balance
between development and residential quality of life in our beautiful
neighborhoods. Professionally, I have managed children’s hospitals across the
country, which has been a most worthwhile blending of public service in the
delivery and improvement of healthcare for children and successful hospital
business and operational management. This combination of dedicated public
service and business experience will lend well to City Council responsibilities
and the future development of our great City. Being on City Council will allow
me the opportunity to contribute and improve District 10 and the City.</p>
<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and
what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
<p class="answer">The most frequent issue that I have heard from District 10
residents is the inability of the Mayor and City Council to listen, involve,
and respect the concerns and recommendations of residents on significant
decisions that affect the city and our neighborhoods. I want to address this
important issue in two ways – short term and long term solutions.</p>
<p class="answer">District 10. For short term ideas, I would develop a series
of meetings with neighborhood and business leaders to discuss issues and
priorities; encourage the inclusion of neighborhood leaders on appropriate
committees and task forces; encourage the Mayor to implement a customer
satisfaction survey process to solicit ideas for improvement; reinstitute
meaningful resident feedback sessions on goals and priorities in the annual
City operational planning and budget process; continue and expand District 10
communication methods; and meet with city department leaders on goals and
initiatives for improvement in District 10 and bordering districts.</p>
<p class="answer">City. With the planned update of Blueprint Denver, the near
completion of our transportation system, and the economic improvement of our
City and State, the timing for long range planning on the growth and
development of the city over the next 20 to 40 years could not be better. This
planning could address (1) the development of all key business areas and
neighborhoods;(2) the creation of expanded transportation / transit feeder
systems; (3) the development and attraction of new business opportunities; (4)
the growth and protection of our wonderful natural resources; (5) establishing
priorities, action plans and resources to implement defined goals and
initiatives; and, most importantly, (6) bringing our City, its business
leaders, and residents closer together by discussing and determining our future
for all stakeholders.</p>
<p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you
would work on as a council member.</p>
<p class="answer">Homelessness – The Mayor is beginning to evaluate and
re-energize the 10 year plan to end homeless, and the top issues identified at
the first homeless meeting were behavioral health / addiction, employment
training, and housing. Another key issue identified was the need to
decentralize homeless treatment services rather than concentrating these
services in one neighborhood / business area, detrimentally affecting quality
of life, business development, and area / city image. I want to work actively
to help address these homeless issues and develop improvement programs to help
individuals in need and create a more positive environment for our businesses
and neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="answer">Transit - Blueprint Denver states, “Blueprint Denver looks at
the important relationship between land use and transportation and advocates
that land use and transportation decisions be made in conjunction with each
other.” As our City develops with greater density, connecting the primary RTD
system with feeder transit systems into local areas will be important in
reducing vehicular use and managing traffic and congestion. Whether these
feeder systems will utilize a modern street car, bus rapid transit, and / or
improved bus services should be further discussed as to the best fit for the
future growth of Denver. Personally, I feel that the more expensive modern
street car will be more flexible without requiring a dedicated street lane,
attractive to residents and tourists, and able to create greater economic
value. Transit system development and economic improvement must be evaluated
together as advocated in Blueprint Denver and will greatly affect District 10
areas as Colfax, Golden Triangle, Cherry Creek, Colorado Boulevard, and other
areas of the city.</p>
<p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased
traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges
associated with new development?</p>
<p class="answer">In three ways: (1) Neighborhood / area planning and its
zoning should define the appropriate parking ratios for retail, office,
residential, and hotel uses. Since one area plan does not fit all, then the
ratios may or may not vary with the City Zoning Code. A development and growth
forecast and analysis as part of the planning should help provide data to
understand developments’ cumulative impact on traffic growth and parking needs.
(2) Transit development as mentioned above. (3) Long range strategic planning
as mentioned above.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on
two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing
restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should
Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
<p class="answer">As I stated above, most City leaders agree that removing the
homeless from our streets by providing housing so that mental health,
addiction, and unemployment assistance can be delivered efficiently would be
most effective. Researching best practices successfully utilized in other
cities to deal with panhandling and other problems may provide solutions that
can be used. To address this homeless situation it will take a combined effort
and support from the City, city departments, community agencies, merchants, and
property owners.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of
red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
<p class="answer">Although the program has reduced speeding on arterial streets
and possibly decreased the number of red light violations at key intersections,
it is still unclear whether public safety has been improved with its use, and
whether the primary emphasis to continue the program has been on revenue
generation for the City. If safety or accident reductions at red lights have
not been demonstrated, then collected data for a given period should be
discussed with the public and a decision made. In the meantime, legitimate
speeding and red light violations should be considered as driving record
violations the same as if the police were present witnessing a violation and
writing a ticket.</p>
<p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will
increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year
later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
<p class="answer">If all elected City Council members would agree to donate the
approved salary increase to a special City fund for use with park maintenance,
homelessness, or some other important cause to help our City on which we agree,
then I would surely donate my salary increase.</p>
<p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has
implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
<p class="answer">The reforms of getting more police officers off of desk jobs
and onto the street; decentralizing some specialized police units to precincts
and commander supervision; and the continuing use of the “Broken Windows”
philosophy of crime correction and prevention have been good for the City. With
additional resources funding increased police recruitment and training, the
Police Department should have sufficient manpower to provide greater services
to protect our citizens and businesses. Chief White should continue to enforce
effective police services to address and prevent crime and at the same time
instill a greater sense of citizen protection. If fully utilized, the expanded
use of police officer body cameras should be helpful in documenting police
practices, preventing any abusive incidents, and protecting the public and
police officers. The greater use of technology should be investigated and
promoted.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges,
including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing
problems in jail management?</p>
<p class="answer">The City Council should play an active role, which, after
some disagreement, was accomplished by appointing two City Council members to
the oversight committee on the Sheriff’s Department and jail service
improvement. City Council has the opportunity to point out that our jail
problems are not “people” problems, although there have been some employees who
have had performance problems. The jail’s problems are “process” problems: they
lack clearly defined, desired work processes and practices and lack the use of
performance measures that monitor work and alert management to deviations from
desired performance. City funds now being used to settle lawsuits can then be
better used for other needed city services.</p>
<p class="answer">City Council should always assist on significant matters and
issues that affect our City and its citizens by encouraging the evaluation and
correction of root cause problems in our city work systems and processes.
Transparent performance measures should be widely used in all city departments
so our citizens can view and understand how well departments are providing
services, how well annual improvement goals and initiatives are being met, and
other areas for improvement. My experience with the national and state Baldrige
Program for Performance Excellence will be helpful in improving
performance.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the
National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not,
what other options should the city pursue?</p>
<p class="answer">I agree with the conclusions of the National Western Center’s
Feasibility Study and feel the City’s use of $856 million in lodging and car
rental taxes will be positive for economic development. I also agree with the
Post’s questions about the City’s ownership and management role, better
governance alternative ideas, and the unannounced funding resources for Phase 2
of the Center’s development.</p>
<p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest
strength and greatest weakness?</p>
<p class="answer">Mayor Hancock presents a positive public image for our City
and promotes growth and development. At the same time, the Mayor and his staff
seem to be reluctant to use neighborhood leader and resident suggestions,
feedback, and ideas and to allow sufficient resident participation in
committees and task forces on major City services and decisions on development,
parks, and other important issues. This has created a lack of trust in City
government, especially related to “over-development” concerns. Great cities
bring all citizens together, using the talents and ideas of everyone to create
and implement a vision and plan to achieve greatness. I would like to help the
Mayor change this real perception held by many citizens and move towards a
greater Denver.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted
collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment
system?</p>
<p class="answer">I am not aware of any difficulties in the city’s current
employment system that would require civil service collective bargaining
rights.</p>
<p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana
working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
<p class="answer">The recreational use of marijuana was approved by our
Colorado voters and is producing revenue that will be used to support our
school system and other local needs. My area of greatest concern is the
production, packaging, and marketing of marijuana edibles and their danger to
our children. The State and City must strengthen regulations on edibles. State
research funds are being used to study the effects of marijuana on children.
Research findings and recommendations need to be evaluated and supported by the
State and City to protect our children and youth.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either
fully or with restrictions?</p>
<p class="answer">No. The second hand effects of marijuana smoke in the public
can be detrimental to public health and welfare, especially for small children.
Marijuana should not be an issue that defines our city’s national image.
Unrestricted public consumption could send the wrong message and be viewed as
Denver’s choice to promote itself as a marijuana destination.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th
Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
<p class="answer">If a smoking ban can be enforced by the City, then it should
be helpful in creating a more pleasant and healthy environment on the 16th
Street Mall and in our parks for all visitors and citizens.</p>
<p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change
current spending priorities for city services?</p>
<p class="answer">I do not have concerns about the city spending priorities,
but, as I mentioned earlier, I am concerned about the city’s future and whether
our annual short term priorities are aligned with our long term vision and
improvement plans for the future. Balancing our annual budget is required, but
most organizations develop improvement initiatives and resource need
identifications that extend over several years in order to be accomplished.</p>
<p class="answer">As an example, the city Economic Development Department has
professional leadership, but, when I discussed defined short term development
strategies with staff, it was not clear what action plans are established and
what specific resources are available to implement initiatives for such
strategies. I am sure other city departments have annual objectives but they
may also lack a longer range plan for improvement.</p>
<p class="answer">This leads back to the need for the City’s long term
strategic vision. We need a plan for city-wide improvement that identifies
initiatives for improvement, forecasts future growth and financial resources,
defines priorities and resource allocation, creates performance measures and
results accountability, and establishes improved community / city teamwork and
spirit.</p>

Denver City Council District 10: Five candidates vie to serve district of
contrasts</a> &bull; April 14</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="name">Anna Jones</h3>
<p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
<p class="answer">District 10 – from Colfax to Country Club and everything and
everyone in between - is diverse and wonderful. The character of our parks,
neighborhoods and business districts contributes to a quality of life like no
other.</p>
<p class="answer">I will work to protect Denver’s character and to accommodate
smart, sound and sustainable growth; bringing unique and highly relevant
professional experience to the council role. In the private sector, my role as
VP with Progressive Urban Management Associates is to work with towns and
cities at a local, state and national level to collectively define their
community values and implement plans to make them happen. My public service
includes a seven year term on the Denver Planning Board and I record I am proud
of.</p>
<p class="answer">In private life I am an active parent in District 10 schools
(Teller, Morey and East) and a community advocate. Revitalization of the East
Colfax corridor is a passion and I was instrumental in forming and guiding its
Business Improvement Districts to spark improvements there. I have been an
engaged member of neighborhood groups like Capitol Hill United Neighborhoods
and Colfax on the Hill. As a parent, neighbor and community organizer I have
proven both desire and ability to contribute to the quality of life and bright
future of District 10.</p>
<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and
what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
<p class="answer">The biggest challenge and opportunity facing District 10 and
all of Denver is growth. In the last 35 years I have seen Denver ride the booms
and busts of the economic cycle. While there are challenges to the rapid
development we’re facing, growth presents an opportunity for us to define our
city moving in to the future. Recent arrivals are fueling our entrepreneurial
culture and improving our quality of life. As the Councilwoman for District 10
I will use my experience to champion a growth model that preserves our healthy
and established neighborhoods while creating a vibrant and walkable city.</p>
<p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you
would work on as a council member.</p>
<p class="answer">Housing - Our rapid growth is impacting cost of living
quickly and dramatically. We need to focus on strategies to maintain affordable
housing in the city. Some ideas are working to improve the Inclusionary Housing
Ordinance, working with non-profit partners on land banking strategies and
examining the creation of a dedicated housing fund. We need to be really
creative about how we keep Denver diverse and interesting and vital without
pricing people out.</p>
<p class="answer">Mobility & Transit- A good transit system is the circulatory
system of a health city. From pedestrian crossings on Colfax, to better transit
access to and through Cherry Creek, mobility is a critical issue in this
district and across the city. We have made great strides with more miles of
bike lanes, better pedestrian mobility and car and bike share programs, and
need to stay focused on strategies to reduce car use - at least some of the
time! Better strategies around parking management and mitigating traffic
congestion also need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased
traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges
associated with new development?</p>
<p class="answer">Denver is going to continue to grow, and that is a good thing
if we are collaborative foresighted about how we manage that growth. In my
view, two things we can’t lose sight of are protecting parks and open space,
and ensuring we are addressing public schools and how they are impacted by
growth. Our parks and neighborhood schools contribute immensely to our
desirable quality of life, and we cannot sacrifice that in the name of
growth.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on
two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing
restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should
Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
<p class="answer">There is no question that we must continue to expand the
services and number of beds and safe shelters available. Denver (and several
other cities including New York, Chicago and Salt Lake) is exploring the use of
social impact bonds as a way to more effectively address the needs of the most
chronically homeless to provide housing that's coupled with mental health and
substance abuse treatment. I applaud that innovative approach and, as
Councilwoman, would like to be part of the conversation.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of
red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
<p class="answer">Speed enforcement should be focused primarily on public
safety. I do not support expansion of photo radar vans until or unless the
correlation to reduced speed or fewer accidents is made clear. I do support red
light cameras at intersections because they have a demonstrated positive effect
on road safety. (A 27% decrease in intersection accidents when first introduced
in Denver in 2008; Commerce City reported a 41% decrease in 2014 after they
were introduced there.)</p>
<p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will
increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year
later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
<p class="answer">This tends to be a heated, emotional issue - rightfully so,
as few other positions, elected or otherwise, set their own salaries. I think
that is what needs to change. I believe an independent panel should be created
and charged with examining a broad set of factors - recent salary history,
comparable private sector pay, comparable public sector pay - to provide the
citizens of Denver with a recommendation every 4 years. I strongly believe that
we need to attract the best, most capable talent to all city positions
including the leadership and pay is a component of that. But the city also
deserves to have a more objective, unbiased approach to setting council
salaries going forward. There are bigger, more important issues to focus on.
The more time we spend on this topic, the less time we have to solve problems
for Denver</p>
<p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has
implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
<p class="answer">My sense is that the reforms that Chief White has implemented
have not had enough time to truly warrant a final judgment of their
effectiveness. I do believe that there is more work to be done to help improve,
and in some cases repair, the relationship between communities and the Denver
Police Department. City Council’s role is to support those who protect and
serve while ensuring a clear and framework for accountability in place.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges,
including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing
problems in jail management?</p>
<p class="answer">The myriad cases that have come out in the past few years are
painful for everyone in our community. Clearly, more needs to be done to
address these issues and find better solutions. I want to look into additional
training programs and support services for peace officers and find ways to
avoid, and ultimately eliminate, the need to spend taxpayer money on
settlements.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the
National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not,
what other options should the city pursue?</p>
<p class="answer">I do support the city’s plan, and think I think it is a
natural extension of the taxes that will generally be paid by tourists and
visitors rather than residents of Denver.</p>
<p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest
strength and greatest weakness?</p>
<p class="answer">One of Mayor Hancock’s greatest assets is facilitating
Denver’s ongoing transformation into a globally connected and competitive city.
Another thing I admire is his strength as a coalition builder. At times his
collaborative nature might keep him from jumping in to resolve issues as
quickly as others might like. But as a fellow Manual High Thunderbolt, I
appreciate his willingness to take one for the team.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted
collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment
system?</p>
<p class="answer">By Charter, the Career Service Authority Board, appointed by
the Mayor, represents most city employees. The right to form a union and
negotiate would take a charter change and a vote of the people. As a referred
measure, a majority of Council and approval of the Mayor would be required.
Should such a proposal be forward to Council, I would want to hear more and
would be open to the proposal.</p>
<p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana
working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
<p class="answer">Broadly speaking, our regulation of sales of recreational
marijuana are working, but as a mother I still remain concerned about the
impacts of legalization. Denver is breaking ground and the world is watching.
Since we are under a microscope, I think we need to move slowly and
deliberately on all issues around marijuana.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either
fully or with restrictions?</p>
<p class="answer">I don’t believe that public consumption of marijuana should
be allowed. I could support special permits for enclosed areas at some events,
much as we have beer gardens at festivals. This is an issue I need to examine
more closely.</p>
<p class="answer">Public consumption of marijuana should not be allowed. I
could support special permits for enclosed areas at some events, much as we
have beer gardens at festivals. But open consumption of marijuana, like open
consumption of alcohol, is not in the best interest of the public.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th
Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
<p class="answer">With regard to the 16th Street Mall, I would want to work
with the Downtown Denver Partnership to think through how banning smoking on
the mall doesn’t just push the issue onto 15th and 17th streets. With regard to
parks, I think the ability to regulate a smoking ban would be difficult and
perhaps ineffective but interested in exploring the issue further.</p>
<p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change
current spending priorities for city services?</p>
<p class="answer">Budget management is one of City Council’s primary
responsibilities. My duty as a representative of District 10 is to ensure that
taxpayer money is spent wisely- on programs that address issues around equality
-- including access to affordable housing and good transportation options --
boost quality of life programs and investments and economic development
opportunities. My professional experience working with cities around the US has
given me a deep well of knowledge to draw from and I am excited to bring that
knowledge home to District 10.</p>

disconnection, seeks opportunity</h3>
<img class="district-map" src="images/district-11-map.jpg">
<p class="modal-text"><strong>By Jon Murray</strong><br>
<em>The Denver Post</em></p>
<p>Not that long ago, much of the Denver City Council's new District 11 was
covered by fields.</p>
<p>But in the past two decades, suburban homes have taken root at a furious
pace. The Green Valley Ranch neighborhood, along with the older suburb of
Montbello, earned the right to a far-northeast district that no longer will
compete with older neighborhoods for clout — at least that's the hope,
including among some of the five candidates for the seat.</p>
<p>"You do feel like a stepchild out here, because you are so disconnected from
the rest of the city," said Melissa Guzman, 48, who moved to Green Valley Ranch
with her husband, Jose, in 2001. "We look like this little hanging-out arm. I
wish people would realize we are part of Denver."</p>
<p>She's referring to the outstretched geographic appendage leading to Denver
International Airport, which shares the district.</p>

Denver City Council District 11: Far-northeast district fights disconnection,
seeks opportunity</a> &bull; April 15</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="name">Stacie Gilmore</h3>
<p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
<p class="answer">I have been very involved in the Far Northeast community for
the past 20 years, and I am proud to be running for the District 11 City
Council seat. I am passionate about our community and committed to making sure
it is represented on all issues affecting our quality of life. We deserve to
live in a community that has smart and sustainable economic growth, jobs that
lead to careers and a beautiful neighborhood where the quality of life supports
our family’s health and well being. In District 11, we have distinct, diverse,
and proud communities from Montbello, to Parkfield, with Green Valley Ranch,
High Point, and the Denver International Airport – we need to connect our
communities with one voice that represents our community. With over two decades
of successful business and community service experience and as a community
resident of Montbello for the last 16 years, I know I can listen, bring people
together and create bridges to ensure residents have the jobs, education and
community that we all deserve.</p>
<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and
what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
<p class="answer">Job creation is one of our biggest challenges and we have the
opportunity in District 11 to create and sustain well paying jobs that will
assist in family and economic stability. As a council member, I will be a
strong collaborator to ensure we have the youth and adult training programs
that will make sure our residents are prepared to compete for and secure new
jobs in the district. Development in our area will be an engine to create more
jobs that will provide sustainable wages for our residents.</p>
<p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you
would work on as a council member.</p>
<p class="answer">Other issues I would like to tackle in our district are 1)
the lack of affordable housing; and 2) a need to investment in infrastructure,
including roads. Affordable housing is needed to provide stability for our
families and in turn the economy. We need to address this gap before we begin
to lose people settling in our city due to a housing storage. Investment in
infrastructure, especially our roads will create transportation solutions that
will facilitate our growth and sustainability. Transportation solutions will
encourage economic growth and create a more livable community for our
residents, business, and tourism. Addressing transportation gaps will enable us
to plan as a community and city on how we in District 11 become the front door
to the city and the Rockies.</p>
<p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased
traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges
associated with new development?</p>
<p class="answer">Development of and investment in traffic and multimodal
infrastructure, will help us address this problem. Addressing public
transportation gaps will also assist with reducing congestion. As we grow as a
city we will have growing pains, and through planning I hope to work on
addressing this need to ensure we maintain a high quality of life for our
residents, visitors, and business.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on
two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing
restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should
Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
<p class="answer">I would like to see Denver address homelessness from a mental
health standpoint. According to a recent news article it was estimated that
two-thirds of homeless people suffer from some type of mental illness. I would
like to look at partnering with different affected industries to explore the
idea of perhaps creating a fund to allocate more resources to shelters, food
banks, and mental health services for the homeless. Homelessness and
panhandling is a huge concern for Denver’s tourism industry and image and it is
a complex issue that I would like to work with other stakeholders to
address.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of
red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
<p class="answer">I support all forms of public safety. I know that red-light
cameras are highly unpopular, but if they are able to change behaviors over the
long term and save lives then they are more than worth it. I would like to
monitor the statistics though to fully understand if these are a majority money
making avenue compared to the percentage of lives saved in the long term.</p>
<p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will
increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year
later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
<p class="answer">I would accept the already implemented raise of council
members’ salaries. As a sitting councilperson I will be required to attend
numerous early morning, evening and weekend meetings and events as a
representative of the district. I plan on working 60 hour work weeks and serve
my community tirelessly. I also support the raise of Denver’s minimum wage so
that all Denver residents can have a deserving, livable wage, in order to
afford housing and have the ability to support their families.</p>
<p class="answer">According to The Denver Post, “figures confirmed that
increases to officials' salaries since 2003 have failed to keep pace with
raises for city employees. Since 2003, The Post found, city employees' raises,
including expected merit bumps for 2015, have averaged 2.3 percent a year. The
cumulative increase has been nearly 32 percent. For the council, the mayor and
other elected officials, salary increases occurred only three times in that
period, averaging out to 1.2 percent a year and amounting to 13 percent
cumulatively.”</p>
<p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has
implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
<p class="answer">I think it is a start, but there remains much work to be
done.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges,
including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing
problems in jail management?</p>
<p class="answer">City Council will need to play a stronger role in the
downtown jail. We need to address inmate abuse and have oversight in reforming
jail management.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the
National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not,
what other options should the city pursue?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes, I do support this plan, but additional funds for this
very ambitious project will need to be raised through private funds and
public-private partnerships.</p>
<p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest
strength and greatest weakness?</p>
<p class="answer">The Mayor’s greatest strength is his commitment to children
and families, the My Denver card is an innovative tool to provide expanded
opportunities for our youth in the city. Affordable housing gaps have created a
weakness that we must address soon to avoid losing new people to the area due
to an affordable housing storage.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted
collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment
system?</p>
<p class="answer">I support the city’s current employment system.</p>
<p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana
working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
<p class="answer">Denver’s approach to regulations on sales of recreational
marijuana seem to be working and have created a business model for the industry
that is being viewed by the rest of the nation.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either
fully or with restrictions?</p>
<p class="answer">No, there should be no public consumption of marijuana.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th
Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
<p class="answer">I would support a smoking ban on the 16th Street Mall. I am
concerned with the reality of how to effectively enforce such a ban though.</p>
<p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change
current spending priorities for city services?</p>
<p class="answer">The spending priorities for city services should have a focus
on addressing our backlog of deferred maintenance items in the city, along with
supporting our youth and families, job training programs, affordable housing,
and transportation.</p>

Denver City Council District 11: Far-northeast district fights disconnection,

</div>
<h3 class="name">Sean Bradley</h3>
<p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
<p class="answer">I am running for Denver City Council because I love this city
and I care deeply about the future of our city and my community. As a father of
two young boys, I want them to grow up in a vibrant community, a safe community
and a city that will embrace their full potential. Just like my family, I want
every single family in our community to experience the Denver Dream, that
regardless of where you grew up, you can accomplish anything.</p>
<p class="answer">As a small business owner, I am passionate about creating an
economically vibrant community, one that offers sustainable jobs and for small
businesses to grow and flourish. I want to create a safe neighborhood where
families can raises their children and for senior to have a place to enjoy
their grandchildren. I am passionate about connecting our neighborhoods so that
we can work together in order to create world class public schools, state of
the art recreation centers, family friendly parks, and healthy community
options for our families.</p>
<p class="answer">I strongly feel that local government should be easily
accessible to its residents and responsive to our community’s needs. As
Councilman, I will have an open door policy and continue meeting families where
they are. We’ll make it easy them to communicate with our office and simply for
my office to connect with them.</p>
<p class="answer">I believe together we can accomplish anything and I have so
many hopes and dreams for our community. We live in the fastest growing
neighborhood in Denver, the most diverse neighborhood in Denver and with the
airport in our district, it is the economic engine in the West. But our work is
never done alone, that’s why I’ll need your help to accomplish our goals.</p>
<p class="answer">I hope you will join me and making Denver an even better city
than the one we moved to, then the one we grew up in, then the one we started
our businesses in and the one we raised our families in.</p>
<p class="answer">Let’s do this together, for the future of our community,
depends on all of us.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and
what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
<p class="answer">Public Safety - In order to have a community that businesses,
potential homeowners, and world class and state of the art schools are willing
to invest in, we must have a community that is safe for everyone. I will work
closely with our police department, community leaders and colleagues to do all
we can to ensure the public safety in our district.</p>
<p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you
would work on as a council member.</p>
<p class="answer">1. Transportation - With a fast growing community such as the
one we live in, you must have a solid transportation plan for families and our
seniors. We also have to ensure that families can travel in and out of the
district in a fluid manner. The roads on 56th and Tower, 56th and Dunkirk, and
Tower and 40th are not conducive to our growth and we must address is now!</p>
<p class="answer">2. We must address the lack of grocery options in our
neighborhood. Our community is literally feeling this and with limited options
in our community, we must address this problem now!</p>
<p></p>
<p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased
traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges
associated with new development?</p>
<p class="answer">First, one must have an understanding of traffic engineering
and how traffic planning is an integral part of urban development. Simply
adding lanes and more streets does not ease congestion. In fact, it make it
worse. The Down-Thomas paradox, commonly known by the triple convergence
theory, states that more driving options actually induce demand. As such, it is
imperative that Denver has sufficient public transportation options. This means
Bus Rapid Transit, Light Rail Transit, and greater use of Transportation
Oriented Development.</p>
<p class="answer">The goal is to not make driving easier and cheaper, or make
it faster to get from A to B; our goal on city council should be to build
successful communities so that A and B are located closer together. Yes, this
is a radical paradigm shift that will result in the investment in and
development of, our local communities. In other words the way to solve traffic
congestion in Denver is with land use planning not simply traffic engineering.
This falls within the realm of city council, which means that my responsibility
as your next council representative for District 11 will be to build vibrant
communities that are walkable and accessible. It is not under we understand the
fundamental problem that we can begin to assign innovative solutions.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on
two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing
restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should
Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
<p class="answer">We really have to strike a balance here. We need to see that
the "Social Impact Bond" to provide services and housing for the homeless is
followed through. We should also ensure that our police officers are trained to
better deal with the homeless.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of
red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
<p class="answer">I am open to this as long as safety is always the priority
for Denver residents.</p>
<p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will
increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year
later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
<p class="answer">What interests me, is that city council, according to city
ordinance, must address this issue every 4 years. It was approved by the
majority of council this year and I really see no reason to return the
raise.</p>
<p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has
implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
<p class="answer">I applaud him for listen to the community and offering some
solutions that can help resolve this challenge we are having in Denver. The
jury is still out on this but I think he's working hard to implement reforms
needed.</p>
<p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges,
including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing
problems in jail management?</p>
<p class="answer">This has been a real black eye for our city but I firmly
believe that Safety Director Stephanie O'Malley, the Chief of Police and
Sheriff are working hard to address this concern and meeting with a great
number of stakeholders throughout the city has been critical. The council
should continue to give teeth to the independent monitor, like they did this
past month. Our role is to not just approve settlements, in fact since 2012
we've settled a little over $10 million due to allegations of excessive force
by the police and deputies. We must work diligently to fix this problem
together.</p>
<p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the
National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not,
what other options should the city pursue?</p>
<p class="answer">I think the city's plan to keep the National Western Center
in Denver is a viable one; although, I would have to look further into it, I
currently seen no reason to oppose it.</p>
<p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest
strength and greatest weakness?</p>
<p class="answer">The Mayor has ran the city now for almost 4 years. His works
will and have spoken for itself and the voters will judge him off that on May
5th. I am not running for city council to be for or against our mayor but I am
running to improve the lives of working families and businesses in District
11.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted
collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment
system?</p>
<p class="answer">"Collective bargaining is an opportunity to for a
constructive dialogue to address working conditions and terms of employment. I
genuinely believe in a balanced approach. That we can continue to create
sustainable jobs but also respectable conversations with and for employees.</p>
<p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana
working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
<p class="answer">I think the regulations are working for the most part; I
would like for us to really get a handle on the inspections and compliance
portion of the regulation. We should consider a standardized checklist so we
can avoid potential duplicate inspections at the same location for multiple
licenses. It’s important that we always ensure the public of its safety but I
also want to make sure this isn’t too costly for the city and business.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either
fully or with restrictions?</p>
<p class="answer">We should treat this the same way we treat alcohol. We don't
not allow public consumption of alcohol so we should do the same for
marijuana.</p>
<p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th
Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
<p class="answer">Not sure about Parks but on the mall there might be a
possibility because of it's uniqueness. Having attended a great number of
council committee hearings and full council meetings, I know that city council
is currently looking at ways to address this.</p>
<p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change
current spending priorities for city services?</p>
<p class="answer">I plan to look at our budget line item by line item and
assess what those priorities are and what programs we might need to adjust. I
plan on being hands on when it comes to our budget.</p>
