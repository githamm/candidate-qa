                <h3 class="name">Robin Kniech</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am running for re-election to continue the momentum and progress I have forged on affordable housing, sustainability and quality City services. I've demonstrated the value of community-led collaboration, working with communities to solve problems ranging from transforming a neglected brownfield into an open space, allowing residents to sell their own vegetables to neighbors, and ensuring new housing development in Denver includes a percentage of affordable housing. I'm running to use this same collaborative approach to help more families find affordable housing and to improve sustainability in all aspects of our daily lives, such as improving access to composting and increasing Denver's low recycling rate. At a time when a booming economy is both benefitting the city, but also challenging our infrastructure to keep up, I bring unique experience on multi-modal transportation finance and management, forged through my leadership on the Denver Union Station project and by representing Denver in the regional planning organization, Denver Regional Council of Governments.  I have both worked with, and negotiated across from developers, preparing me for the on-going challenge of ensuring growth accommodates new residents while also preserving character and improving the quality of life for existing residents and neighborhoods.</p>          
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Inaccessibly High Cost of Housing and Homelessness. While our overall economy is strong, the challenge of homelessness persists and the lack of affordable housing in our community grows worse by the day. Homelessness is a crisis for our most vulnerable residents (many of whom are families with children), and it also presents challenges for communities and business near where the homeless live on the streets without the emergency facilities they need.  Denver has saved lives and made strides by housing hundreds of homeless individuals and families, but we need to further expand daytime shelter and services while we identify new financing tools to create the permanent housing that will end homelessness for as many families as possible. I have already laid the foundation for a conversation with the Mayor and our community and am identifying possible sources of revenue Denver could dedicate to affordable housing, and if I am re-elected, I intend to bring our community together to support one of those sources for a long-term commitment to expanding affordable housing for low and moderate income families, including entry level homeownership opportunities.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">1) Multi-modal transportation and open space.  Boom and bust cycles are nothing new in the West, but Denver is seeing a frantic pace of new housing and commercial activity that is challenging our city's infrastructure. We need to be much more aggressive about creating new open spaces and transportation solutions that keep pace with this change, including thinking beyond RTD to more city-led transit efforts. If elected I will continue to build on my record in Denver and with the Denver Regional Council of Governments to prioritize multi-modal transportation plans and investment to keep up with change and growth in the city and the region.  I will also continue to advocate for city investments in new open space in existing neighborhoods, like my work in Globeville, and in-fill neighborhoods with new development where these amenities are necessary to complement higher density.</p>
                <p>2) Employment and other strategies to engage disconnected youth.  Over my first term, the city has made great strides in expanding food for hungry kids, free recreation center access and more after-school options.  But we need more targeted efforts to create connections between older teens and positive activities and opportunities.  For example, Denver needs to expand our efforts to get our teens access to summer jobs that help them earn money and develop job skills.  We have wonderful opportunities to build career pathways for young people into construction jobs we as a city create at DIA or on the National Western Center, and we should have focused apprenticeship programs to ensure we get the folks who need these opportunities the most into those training opportunities.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Described extensively above: ensuring affordable housing is a consistent component, to mitigate the increased prices new development brings; and more open space and multi-modal transportation investments to expand alternative choices to driving where density is increasing.  It is not always true that new development results in decreased parking, it just sometimes moves parking from street curbs to underground garages, so some of our work involves educating and supporting our residents to change their expectations and habits for how to park in dense areas.  In major redevelopments, we have to work hard to leverage the development itself to provide the improvements and amenities to support growth.  Where projects are smaller and more one-by-one, city investments to ensure adequate infrastructure will be necessary.  And in all cases, we need to invest in the city employees our residents call upon to plan, engineer and implement/maintain the transportation and open space we expand to support growth.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">Described extensively above: ensuring affordable housing is a consistent component, to mitigate the increased prices new development brings; and more open space and multi-modal transportation investments to expand alternative choices to driving where density is increasing.

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I have requested numerous changes in the city's next contract for camera enforcement, including:</p>
                <p>1) better/larger signage at eye level noticing people of the photo enforcement to deter speeding before citations</p>
                <p>2) use of visible real-time ""your speed is___"" at the same time as photo enforcement, so we really are focused on deterring activity, not citations, and so that when someone does get a ticket, they see right at the time what speed they were going</p>
                <p>3) specifically linking a significant portion of the revenue from photo enforcement to traffic, pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements and maintenance</p>
                <p>4) more consistent rotation of mobile enforcement throughout the city, and reduced usage in short stretches with reduced speed that are confusing for motorists</p>
                <p>With these changes, I think it is important for Denver to continue to have as many tools as possible for reducing speeds and red light violations, both of which have been responsible for numerous deaths and injuries in a city where more and more of our residents need to be able to get around safely on foot, with strollers, on bicycles or in wheelchairs.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">Given the fact that city council is a full time plus job, that the increases are on-pace with the increases provided to city employees, and they follow the formula laid out by the voters in Denver's charter, the salary set for the next council is the one I believe all members of council should be paid, including myself if I am fortunate enough to be re-elected.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Chief White has been an effective leader for change within DPD.  He has worked to redistribute scarce resources after five years of hiring freezes in ways that have brought more help to the areas of the city with the most police calls, and consistently scheduling teams to work together has resulted in more coordinated, proactive policing on special goals set based on the crime statistics in each sub-district.  We have seen a decrease in NEW use of force litigation since Chief White has been hired (many of the recent, prominent cases originated under the prior administration), and where problems continue to persist, he has taken a strong stance of zero tolerance, firing bad officers and being willing to re-examine his own policies and procedures.  We definitely have more work to do, particularly on challenging deeply held perceptions that police, like all residents, may bring to their interactions with community members.  And I expect the Chief to take many of the good suggestions that come from our Independent Monitor on how best to use Body Cameras, how to adjust our policies on shooting at moving vehicles and other important issues currently under review.  It is difficult to see some officers resist the changes the chief is making, but in some ways, as we bring on new generations of officers with more education and new energy, it is in fact his willingness to make change even in the face of some resistance, that indicates we are headed in the right direction, even though we have more work to do.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">Council has no access to confidential personnel cases and limited oversight over day to day operations in the city, where the charter assigns these duties to the Mayor.  But we have oversight powers to ask questions about policies and procedures, and to ensure that any changes requiring legislative approval are made as quickly as we become aware of them.  We also have a responsibility to ensure the staffing and supervision levels, that clearly have played a role in the challenges, are addressed before allocating funding for the budget to pay for them.  We rely greatly on the Independent Monitor to have access to confidential materials we do not, and to advise us on best practices, and I strongly supported the recent changes we made to ensure him access to the policy and data information he needs to advise us.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, this is a way to have tourism pay the way for a tourism-related project, and creatively does so by extending an existing tax rather than instituting a new one.  The city should, however, ensure that we have strong, decision-making authority in the operations of the complex, commiserate with this investment.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Hancock's strength to-date was his boldness in pursuing 2A to ensure a financially stable future for the city for generations to come. His challenge to-date has been matching his clear and evident empathy with poor and struggling moderate income residents in our city with equally far-reaching and bold solutions.  While I applaud him on supporting individual affordable housing policies and projects, at a certain point, the city must decide we have a role as a leader in challenging soaring housing prices, persistent homelessness, and wage stagnation among our working residents.  I believe he is headed in the right direction with his Housing Plan, and I believe the test of his next term will be whether he champions one or two large initiatives that really invest our city resources into supporting the most vulnerable in our community.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Collective bargaining provides a structure through which employers can work with their employees to solve challenges, and ensures employees have a voice before decisions impacting them are made. Collective bargaining doesn't mean that the city can't make cuts it has to in hard times, as has been proven with our safety departments, who consistently made sacrifices as needed during the recession.  For these reasons, I support collective bargaining, including for city employees.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes.  We have very high compliance on important issues, like no businesses being caught making sales to minors, and very few complaints from citizens to 3-1-1.  The revenue generated by the industry proves that people are moving away from the black market to retail outlets, and the revenue being generated is both covering the costs of regulation and helping to make the city better by funding general city services.  We need greater support from the state on regulating edibles to protect the safety of the public and on oversight of medical marijuana regulations.  I'm very supportive of the ordinance we are in the process of passing to outlaw unregulated grows that operate outside the retail and medical regulations, they are a danger to the public and this ordinance will greatly improve safety in our city.  </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">We should not allow public consumption in public spaces like along streets/sidewalks and parks.  I believe we will likely need to contend with some kind of permit to allow public consumption within specified venues, similar to liquor licensing, because we continue to have a challenge with where and how visitors to Denver, who do not have a private residence, can legally consume.  And we know that if we don't provide a legal, directed solution for them, then they are more likely to consume illegally in our outdoor public spaces.  But this conversation will require careful consideration and input from all stakeholders.  </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, I believe there is strong evidence that limits on smoking improve health outcomes by many smokers cutting down on their own smoking, and by reducing the unpleasant experience of involuntary second hand smoke by those who do not smoke themselves.  Whether just the Mall or all city parks is a question I would need to debate more fully with my colleagues with input from the public.  But I'm open to the conversation.  </p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">As Chair of the Council Finance committee, I believe the overall funding of various priorities is fairly well balanced right now, but we have some challenges that we need to solve:</p>
                <p>&mdash;the city currently provides no funding for new sidewalks, and given the development and multi-modal priorities outlined above, this is not sustainable and we must identify new sources, whether city funds or other sources to help provide sidewalks</p>
                <p>&mdash;we need a dedicated source of revenue for housing, we cannot just allocate a different amount of money each year, mixed-income housing developments take 2-3 years to plan and build, so there must be a long-term reliable amount that we can count on and plan for if we expect to build more affordable homes than we have to-date. Funding housing will save us money in other areas, such as social services and jail.</p>
                <p>&mdash;as described, I would dedicate revenue from photo enforcement to pedestrian, bike and traffic safety investments</p>
                <p>&mdash;we must find a way to lower the jail population, which is growing at a faster pace than predicted, to control spending on the jail, without endangering inmate or deputy safety</p>

                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am running for Denver City Council at Large to bring a native voice to the Council. I have lived the boom and bust that Denver once was, and I know the challenges ahead need to be faced with a leader that understands the historical significance of Denver and the need to grow and develop. I can reconcile the growth with the needs of all communities that make up our great city and take Denver to the next level. I have worked tirelessly for over 23 years to help build a Denver that we all can be proud of. As a community activist I pushed to have laws changed, raised 20 million of dollars for education and created lasting programs that serve the poorest communities in Denver. I will bring to the Denver City Council the passion that only a native son could have. I look to build bridges, form opportunities for all residents, create smart economic growth and be a steadfast leader that will not pander to the status quo. I will be a champion for every resident. I will listen first, speak second and never waver from my values that I carry as a leader, to always build coalitions and create a unified city.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Safety reform-We need to move to have the Sherriff become an elected position and not a Mayoral appointee. Secondly, offer officers that have been on the force for over 25 years the opportunity to retire without penalty. They would receive a 1000 hours of pay as well as full benefits. Over a three year period, we would be able to bring on 300-400 new officers. We cannot fix anything with the police if we don’t change the culture that is present.</p>

                <p class="answer">1. Create the infrastructure and identify the needs, opportunities and priorities that will guide families to the supportive services they need with follow up.</p>
                <p class="answer">2. Ensure that there is effective transparency with DHS and perform annual audits on the agency.</p>
                <p class="answer">3. Develop a blueprint for how the city, schools, business leaders, community groups, and parents will work together to support and improve student achievement, high school completion, and postsecondary access.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">We have to ensure that we meet the resident’s needs and provide for healthy growth. We all know that Denver can only grow up and over current areas. As a native, I firmly believe that we must remember the historical significances of these neighborhoods and do everything possible to balance growth with that. I would commission a committee of residents, developers, policy leaders and each would have an equal vote and input. As an educator, I have heard from many that Denver is just too expensive and is not listening to the needs and wants of the residents. Many communities are ready to burst at the seams and overdevelopment has changed some historical landscapes permanently.  The challenges of growth bring opportunity for Denver to be the city we want it to be and not just one person. That is what I will bring to the table, a voice that speaks for the community.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">We have to reconcile this and it first starts with the decriminalization of homelessness. I was a homeless teen here in Denver and it is because of supportive services that I survived. I was invested in by many in the community. We have to reinvest in our homeless, transient and couch surfers. We need to work with the mental health community to create a model that can provide the support some may need.</p>
                <p class="answer">We need to continue to partner with the shelters and social service agencies to build capacity, buy more parcels of land to provide for affordable housing and expand the services of addiction support.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">NO!</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">When I am elected I will return the  pay raise.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Chief Robert White inherited a mess but there needs to be systematic change and that comes by changing the culture. There is more to be done. I propose that officers that have been on the force for over 25 years the opportunity to retire without penalty. They would receive a 1000 hours of pay as well as full benefits. We would be able to bring in 3-4 recruit classes a year. Over a three year period, we would be able to bring on 300-400 new officers. We cannot fix anything with the police if we don’t change the culture that is present.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">We need to move to have the Sherriff become an elected position and not a Mayoral appointee. As a Councilmember at Large, this will be one of the first issues I champion. The Denver Sherriff's Department is under a huge amount of stress do to low moral, lack of accountability and leadership failures in many departments. The public needs to have full confidence in our jails and currently that is at an all time low. City Council should lead on this area because when someone dies in custody, the responsibility falls on them and the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">YES. The NWS is an institution and should be treated as such. Denver for far to long has not done a good enough job of embracing what we have and helping to build it up. There are so many opportunities that can come with a revamped NWS. It could be used as a year round attraction, as an educational center and additional convention space. The communities of Swansea, Globeville and Elyria deserve for the city to step up and provide beautification and growth that provides for the residents.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength is his dedication to the city.</p>
                <p class="answer">His greatest weakness is his tunnel vision regarding development.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">YES!</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe the regulations are working but the taxes are not fair and need to be reconsidered.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">Public consumption of marijuana should be allowed only in certain circumstances. Denver hosts many festivals where their focuses is Cannabis and the usage or celebration of. Since voting to regulate marijuana like alcohol, we have not done a great job. We need to provide a space for tourist, locals and people that can not smoke in their homes to medicate or recreate. I am in favor of smoking clubs because tourist are left to smoke in hotel rooms, on the street corners and in rental cars.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am in favor of the ban on the 16th Street Mall but not in parks. We can not govern the personal preferences of individual choices in more open public places like parks. My hope would be that the great residents of Denver would be respectful and step away from crowds and children.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">Affordable and Sustainable Living. Which include programs for self-sufficiency, homelessness and housing services.</p>
                <p class="answer">Safety and the Quality of Life for Citizens of Denver. Reform the Denver Police Department, move to have the Sherriff elected. Decrease the crime statistics in Denver by creating community partnerships with police, NRO’s, school leaders and non-profits that create comprehensive programs that work to deter crime that includes crime prevention, restorative justice and mentorship programs.</p>
                <p class="answer">Solid waste and the expansion of recycling and the compost program citywide. In order to be a World Class city we must embrace the move to reduce waste.</p>

                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">Because I believe we need people on City Council who are going to be fiscally responsible and treat taxpayer dollars as sacred and not their own private slush fund.</p>                
            	<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Housing is becoming very unaffordable in Denver right now and I would get rid of unnecessary land use regulations that are prohibiting more affordable housing units from being built.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">I would work on getting our roads paved so that they aren't destroying our cars and I would make sure Denver parks and open spaces are preserved so that Denver residents can maintain their quality of life.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would make sure the proper infrastructure is in place to handle new developments before deciding to move forward on any given project. What's the use of building a gas station it's going to take twenty minutes to turn into from an intersection?</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">People who are homeless need homes before they need anything else. Support services are just that, they don't provide homes for the homeless, nor does banning panhandling and public camping.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">No I absolutely do not. Not as a revenue generator for a City Council that can't balance a budget no matter how much money they collect.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would return raises. They was a very immoral decision on the part of every council member who voted for that. </p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">No they haven't worked, and the only thing that needs to be done is for everyone including law enforcement officers is to uphold their oath to serve and protect, not harass and neglect.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">In the Charter, City Council is responsible for oversight of the jail and should therefore do it's job of overseeing.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">As of now yes. I don't know of a better alternative and it's something that needs to be done.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">His greatest strength is that he is an incumbent with a lot of money. His greatest weakness is that a lot people see him as a puppet for developers.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">No they shouldn't. Our current employment system is just fine.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">No they're not. The high sales tax has created an even bigger black market than before. I would support repealing the ordinance that made recreational pot shops legal in Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No. It should be banned.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes. That is a place where families take their children and we should not allow our babies to inhale tobacco smoke whether indoors or outdoors.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would look into privatizing so that much needed services would be provided without costing taxpayers too much.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Deborah "Debbie" Ortega</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">It has been an honor to work for the people of Denver as the At-Large Councilwoman since 2011.  I want to continue to make Denver a better place of all its citizens and for our future generations. I have the knowledge and experience to make the City work for everyone. I am committed to ensuring that the impacts of city decisions on all segments of our community are considered as we strive to create a sustainable community with economic and house opportunities for everyone.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Strengthen our economy!  We must maintain a strong economy that provides jobs and opportunity for all segments of our community.  I am working to ensure Denver residents are prepared for the jobs that will result from the public investment in reconstructing I-70, redevelopment of Brighton Blvd, and the new facilities at the National Western complex.  I have also been working with the creative industries – film/video production, visual & performing arts, etc. – to determine how the City can foster growth in this sector of our economy.</p>
                <p class="answer">The second major challenge is affordable housing. We must have a diversity of housing options and price points to attract and keep a talented workforce that is supporting the new, growing and existing businesses in our community.  We must also provide choice for baby boomers to age in place or live in non-traditional housing focused on seniors, and we need housing for families at all income levels.  At the same time we must have enough shelter beds for homeless individuals to have a safe place to rest their heads and access resources.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Prioritize efficient delivery of basic city services.  In 2012 Denver voters approved Measure 2A which provided the City with a solid tax base in order to provide basic services – public safety, parks, recreation centers, trash services and roads.  Denver severely cut city services during the recession. Now that our economy is improving and we have a solid tax base, it is time to reinvest in our infrastructure.  I am proud that we have added additional personnel to our public safety agencies and are making major investments in our roads, parks, and other facilities.  Public safety also includes our fire department and emergency response capacities and I have been devoting particular attention to hazmat by rail safety.   I will continue to focus on and support the development of programs like the implementation of the Solid Waste Master Plan that moves the City towards a single, and less costly, system of trash collection from the three systems we support today.</p>
                <p class="answer">Protect the quality of life in Denver.  The rapid growth we are seeing coming out of the recession is putting added stress on the areas of dense development and our transportation networks from major highways to arterial roads and even residential streets.  We need to address the added growth, transportation and transit needs in ways that maintain the character of communities and the city as a whole that have always made Denver such a desirable place to live, work and raise our families.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Some of the very neighborhoods that are already parking challenged need to be involved in the conversation so the implementation results in a balance between ensuring parking is available for customers who come from outside the area and enough bike racks and safe bike lanes for neighbors from nearby neighborhoods to also patronize local businesses.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">The issue of homelessness is complicated.  To help the chronic homeless we must address the underlying mental health issues that result in people living on the streets.  We also must make sure there is a sufficient shelter space and day service to reduce conflict with the nearby residents or businesses.  At the same time, we must support construction of housing that is affordable to prevent families from being displaced and becoming homeless.  I don’t have a magic wand that will solve the issue.  I do have experience as a member and chairman of the board of Del Norte Neighborhood Development Corporation and as the first executive director of Denver’s Homeless Commission providing shelter, services and housing for homeless and low-income residents.  Denver must identify a stable source of funding for development of affordable housing and partnerships to provide needed services.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support Denver’s red light cameras and photo radar because it slows traffic down and has reduced accidents.  My own experience is that these keep me and other drivers, aware of the need to be vigilant in driving safely.  They are not that hard to avoid; just don’t speed or run red lights, especially given our increased vehicle, pedestrian and bike traffic.  They free up police resources to be handling other matters, but I also support having police on the street to help keep our ever-more-crowded roads safer.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I voted to adjust the salaries for all elected official positions for the next four-year term, same as City Council has historically done at the end of a term - for the incoming elected leaders.  The City Charter governs how pay raises for elected officials are set - in fact - the voters approved this newer method during the Hickenlooper administration.   This is done every four years using a set formula along with data researched by Denver’s Human Resource Department.  A seated council cannot vote itself a raise.  We recently voted an increase for the next city council that will take office in July, and the pay will not be increased again until 2019.  I am open to a discussion about changing the charter provisions.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">There is more to be done to change long term culture problems in police conduct here and elsewhere in the country, while giving our officers the support they need to do the dangerous work of protecting the public and fostering mutual respect between the police and the community. I also firmly believe that our emergency responders who frequently deal with horrific incidents in our community should be provided counseling for PTSD.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">An extensive internal and external review of the department is underway that may result in policy recommendations requiring city council approval. Whether someone is in jail pending trial or has been found guilty of a crime, they must be treated fairly and justly.  This environment requires a balanced approach to allow our officers to do their job and I look forward to receiving the results of the review and working with the departments and community to make changes that will assure the consistent, humane treatment of inmates while also providing our employees with a safe working environment.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">There needs to be much more public discussion and dialogue prior to deciding if this is the best way to fund the redevelopment of the National Western complex. Many more details need to be provided including the ownership structure for the new complex and the governance structure.  I am excited about the opportunities redevelopment for improving the long-neglected neighborhoods Globeville, Swansea and Elyria.  We must make sure that the infrastructure needs of these neighborhoods are not neglected as we rebuild the National Western Complex and I-70 is reconstructed.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Hancock’s greatest strength has been articulating goals for the City, such as the Office of Ec. Development’s Jumpstart Denver, Denver Moves pedestrian and bicycle master plan and a housing plan that should be formally adopted by City Council  There will be at least 5, and as many as 10, new council members after the election.  His biggest challenge will be to establish a collaborative working relationship with the new Council and to get Adams County and Denver on the same page about changes to DIA’s IGA.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am supportive of establishing collective bargaining for city employees that balances worker rights with public safety considerations.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe Denver has tackled the issues surrounding legal recreational and medical marijuana well.  We worked diligently with all interested parties/groups to implement the will of the voters and address issues of specific concern to Denver within the state and constitutional framework.  There are, however, still challenges especially with the industries’ inability to open bank accounts and how our program is implemented as to the public, our communities and the regulated industry.  Council recently adopted new ordinances to address health and safety issues caused by alcohol-based hash oil processing and large unregulated grow operations.  I think our laws and rules need to change as new issues arise and the industry evolves.  My focus throughout this process has been, and will continue to be, on limiting access to marijuana by children.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No.  Open and public consumption of marijuana is prohibited by Amendment 64. The Amendment states, “. . . nothing in this section shall permit consumption that is conducted openly and publicly or in a manner that endangers others.”</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would tend to lean in support: however I would want to have a better sense of what the public wants and full opportunity for the public to weigh in as to particular no-smoking zones, such as the 16th Street Mall, parts of parks or certain types of parks.  We should keep in mind Denver has over 5,000 acres of urban parks plus 14,000 acres of mountain parks which, in particular, may need smoking bans in times of high fire hazard. I also don’t want to give expectations that Denver will have the where-with-all in staffing to enforce such a law if passed in all parks (including Mtn. parks) and I am very sensitive to another punitive law towards homeless individuals before we have the 24 hour rest and resource center promised when the no camping ban was adopted.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe we need to invest in infrastructure that will increase the walkability and bikeability of our city.  A number of areas of the City are lacking or have decaying infrastructure such as roads in disrepair and sidewalks.  Many of these areas are on major roads where people walk and catch the bus. I think we need to commit more resources to meeting these needs and to assuring our streets are safe for cyclists and as well as motorists.  Another example is that we are building pedestrian bridges to provide access to transit. We need to make sure we can keep them useable through the winter months.  Whether these needs are funded through annual appropriations or a designated funding stream is currently under discussion.</p>
                <p class="answer">I will continue to work on insuring that the neighborhoods of Globeville, Elyria and Swansea receive the community benefits they have asked for in their recently adopted neighborhood plans and comments to the I-70 Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) and on the National Western Center, both of which will have significant impacts to their community, yet pose incredible opportunities for these neighborhoods.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Kayvan Khalatbari</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">Because I love this city and see it getting away from its values and what has made it great as we deal with this incredible transition and growth period.  I will provide an incredibly different perspective than any of our current City Council members as I have more business experience than all of them combined and more philanthropic experience than any one of them that doesn't revolve around a photo opportunity.  I couldn't care less for special interests, the status quo or assuming that just because we've done something in the past that it needs to continue being done that way.  We are rapidly evolving as a city and need folks who think truly progressively, something our current Council appears incapable of.  I went from homeless 7 years ago to having seven local businesses that employ about 100 people, are community-driven to the max and engage in and understand the problems of the people we surround ourselves with.  I'm a real person.</p>	                   
            	<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Affordable housing in our city's core because of the free pass our current City Council and Mayor have given developers to run amok and ignore this issue without repercussion.  This issue creates many of the others plaguing our city as they relate to far fewer purchasable properties that keep people from home ownership, public transportation inadequacies and too many cars on the road as more and more people are required to move into the suburbs and make their way into the city each day, stagnant wages and a loss of many artistic and creative opportunities in our city core that can't afford to exist any more. </p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Access for children to creative, artistic, thought-based and entrepreneurial services after school.  While Mayor Hancock made recreational centers available for free to DPS students, physical activity isn't going to provide our youth an opportunity to excel in life and understand that there are bigger and better things out there for them.  Our public schools are in shambles with an outdated curriculum and lack of funding to support the great teachers we have within them.  As hard as we will need to work to fix that issue, and we will try, I think we can provide other services to kids in these other disciplines to engage them constructively and do so with many of our existing private foundations, organizations and entities and without costing the city much, if anything.  Obviously to get kids to these services will require transportation, something lacking for many low-income families, but I have some great public and private ideas here as well to bridge this gap.</p>
                <p>While public transportation and our out of control police force are towards the top of my list, I don't just come to the table with solutions for existing issues, but rather solutions for future issues that aren't apparent problems yet, or at least aren't noticed by the general public yet.  We need someone in Council with some foresight and not simply a reactive mindset.  I think establishing the epicenter of our nation's hemp economy in Denver is the most impactful thing we can do as a city right now.  This is an industry that is about to take off in a big way on an international level, will be 100x larger than medical or social cannabis, less controversial than both of those and a foundation for a truly local economy, something I believe is the solution to many of our existing problems locally and nationally.  We are already legally growing hemp in this state, but it hasn't taken off because we don't have the processing facilities available here or anywhere else in the country because of our Federal government's ignorant association with this plant to cannabis.  If we build these processing facilities here in Denver, production of hemp will expand across Colorado and we will create tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of economic development, all of it sitting on the table right now just waiting.  I can and will bring the money in to get this done and have this plan come to fruition during my Council term.  We will then be far less reliant on international and national sources for food, textiles, fuel, construction materials and on and on.  We can create a truly local and self-sufficient community.  Let's be the progressive example and guiding light for hemp as we have for medical and social use cannabis.</p></p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">By not allowing restaurants and bars to be piled up on one another in our wonderful and eclectic neighborhoods.  As an example, allowing places like Punch Bowl Social to inhabit a neighborhood like Baker on Broadway have done that neighborhood a huge disservice.  I own a business in the neighborhood and know hundreds and hundreds of constituents who work and live the area who agree with me.  Parking is becoming non-existent, crime is up and we've lost the opportunity for more necessary services to go into that space since they opened. Examples like this exist all over the city.  Where is the push for more local and organic markets and non-booze-fueled modes of entertainment that families and the rest of us can enjoy in our neighborhoods?  Why are we being forced to leave our own neighborhoods to be entertained while alcohol and traffic issues continue to erode our community fabric?  Local, neighborhood economies.  It's really that simple.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">To say that homelessness is a crime is an abomination and our current Council and Mayor should be ashamed of themselves for pushing for that definition.  It's a public health issue that needs real solutions at the root of the problem, not some tired attempt to cover it up.  Lack of affordable housing and access to harm reduction services for drug addicts are the two main perpetuators of this problem and the City has done little more than nothing to provide support to correcting this.  They've given developers a free pass to ignore the construction of low-mid-income housing and the ability for people to purchase properties and establish roots in our community.  They've provided nothing in the way of support to harm reduction programs to finally start viewing drug addiction as a public health issue and not a crime.  We are creating our own cycles of homelessness by our failed and archaic policies on these two issues.  I've already pledged to donate half of my Council salary to the Harm Reduction Center and the rest will soon be earmarked for other progressive groups that are working on creating these solutions. If our current elected officials don't feel this is a priority, I will do what I can to tackle it myself, and not vote to give myself the maximum raise as this current Council and both my incumbent competitors just did. </p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">Heck no.  These things are downright criminal and do nothing to improve public safety.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">Per my comments above, I have already pledged to donate half of my salary to the Harm Reduction Action Center, with the other half to be given away soon to local and deserving progressives in our community.  Not only did our current Council provide the maximum raise to themselves, they kept that decision out of the hands of Denver voters. Abhorable.  I am running for office as a public service, not to bankroll a comfy lifestyle or to pursue future political aspirations.  A true democracy is driven by people with varied life/business experiences, not career politicians looking to benefit their bottom line.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">While the police force appears to have made strides to increase their levels of compassion and accountability within their ranks, we need to do more.  I think the city would benefit greatly from more peace officers capable of mediating and integrating with our communities and less police officers roaming our city streets.  Don't take this as me saying I want police gone, because that is far from the case.  I just think we use their services in many environments where they don't provide a benefit and we end up wasting taxpayer money and coming across as a militaristic and lacking in compassion. The utilization of peace officers means more jobs, more watchful eyes on the streets, a better relationship with our communities and getting these folks back to being public servants and not instigators of $10+ million gone in lawsuits for police brutality and misuse of power.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think pushing for sensible reform in drug policy and homelessness would be a great start.  If people aren't thrown in jails for public health issues it becomes harder to abuse them in jails.  Aside from that though, more accountability and less militaristic ideals with all our police and prison staff.  Bad apples need to be removed from the police force and held accountable legally, not given paid time off and a slap on the wrist for gross misuses of power.  It's all about creating a culture shift and that starts with providing examples of very real consequences of action.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">I'm not opposed, but I think other options should always be looked at to perhaps supplement this revenue.  This is a massive state and regional benefit and it would seem outsiders should do some chipping in as well.  We're also proposing giving back a large sum of cannabis tax money, much of it earned from tourists.  Why not either repurpose this money or lower those taxes?</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">They are one in the same, the fact that he is out of touch.  Unfortunately it makes his strength only an asset for him and a liability for this city.  His isolation and unwillingness to engage in a real way has kept him out of touch with the needs of the communities he should be serving, yet close to developer cronies who are funding his reelection without any true competition to hold him accountable.  I think he's wrong for Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am not opposed to the discussion of collective bargaining rights for civil service employees.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">Of course they are, but they can be better.  We've seen domestic violence and traffic fatalities go down, as well as teen use.  We've seen tax revenue generated to the point that we are talking about giving it back to taxpayers and we've seen more and more studies show that these businesses reduce crime in the areas they inhabit.  The main issue that needs to be addressed is operating hours and extending these from 7pm to 10pm for retail cannabis stores in Denver.  Most municipalities surrounding Denver allow these stores to be open until 10pm, which forces people in Denver to either drive a distance or buy on the black market after 7pm.  All this while alcohol sales are allowed until midnight, a drug that kills 1 in 7 working age Coloradans according to the CDC.  Why not allow our residents similar access to the SAFER alternative?  Let's not forget the economic value being lost here and not just in the millions in tax revenue being shipped outside this city.  With 150-200 cannabis dispensaries in Denver, each with 5-10 employees onsite at any given time, those additional three hours of operation each day are losing this city thousands of labor hours each and every day, for no logical reason.  The sky never fell, folks.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, of course.  The intent of Amendment 64 was to equalize cannabis with alcohol.  The inability of folks to legally consume is creating an epidemic with regard to public consumption tickets being issued and a conundrum for tourists.  It is foolish to tell millions of people around the world that it is legal to purchase cannabis in this state, but not give them an opportunity to legally consume it here.  Hotels are predominantly owned by large chains that disallow it all together.  Boutique hotels have come on board to try and address this issue but haven't made a dent because the Colorado Clean Indoor Air Act greatly limits the number of rooms that can allow smoking.  While I don't believe cannabis cafes are the solution, there needs to be some consideration for incorporating this use into existing venues.  I believe additional restricted licenses should be available to existing bars and venues that designate interior spaces for the vaporizing of cannabis and designated outdoor areas where tobacco smoking is allowed to be used for the combustion of cannabis plant material.  I believe this solution integrates this use into our existing city fabric much more responsibly than cannabis cafes, which segregate these users and perpetuate stereotypes that simply aren't true.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I'm torn on this issue.  I don't believe government should be in control of an issue like this, but also understand the concerns associated with wanting to do it.  I need to speak with all stakeholders (business owners, city officials, residents and tourists) more to make an informed decision.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I really love what Denver has done with their Arts & Venues Department, creating a self-funded entity that is reliant on itself to be efficient with the use of its money and make good decisions with it because the alternative is the inability to function.  More accountability for how money is spent and incorporating a traditional business practices to balancing cash flow would go a long way and reduce the necessity for perpetually rising taxes.  As someone who has more business experience than all folks currently in City Council and our Mayor combined, I have zero reason to believe I can't bring from more sustainable business practices to how we raise and spend our money.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Rafael Espinoza</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">The economy has put tremendous pressure on Northwest Denver’s character and infrastructure these last 4 years. The people have found my opponent non-responsive and incapable of dealing with these comprehensive challenges effectively. I have a 16-year history of providing community-centric solutions in my North Denver neighborhood, so stakeholders asked me to serve as North Denver’s City Councilperson because of my problem solving skills, professional competency, and record of commitment to the people of Northwest Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">The biggest challenge is destabilizing development that threatens the opportunity and character that make Northwest Denver so desirable to the people that continue to make it home. I would use the office of City Council to shape development, manage growth through place-making, direct more resources into local infrastructure solutions, and proactively work with DPS to capitalize on opportunities to deliver neighborhood-based education in Northwest Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Parking and traffic, like many of the issues facing the district, these too, are development related. The zoning code is developer-friendly regarding open space and parking requirements, both result in increased density, less off-street parking and more cars on the road. The zoning code largely overlooks the existing fabric and infrastructure. Deference to the existing fabric must be codified to some degree to maintain the quality of life that has served Northwest Denver communities for over 100-years; empirically our area has proven to be sustainable model.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">My approach would be to raise traffic and parking issues every time the intensity of use goes up on sizable projects. I’d establish specific criteria for parking and traffic studies that go beyond the normally abbreviated areas. Often, known failing intersections are omitted from traffic studies to avoid shedding light on a problem, I understand these issues enough to know what to question.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">The money spent and the measures taken haven’t solved the problem. Rather than perpetually kicking the can down the road, I would advance a package of solutions to address the panoply of reasons behind the homeless issue to improve outcomes for the homeless and improve quality of life in Denver. These concepts will be developed to be revenue neutral and will take more than passionate pleas when voting in the minority, but rather creativity, political will, and diplomacy in garnering support city-wide, and on Council, to see them to fruition.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do not support photo speed enforcement, but I partially support red-light cameras. Considering the potential consequences of running red lights, and the general regularity with which it is done, enforcing the running of red lights is a worthwhile endeavor. The fines should begin low, then structured and weighted towards penalizing habitual offenders. However, I do not support stop-line enforcement utilizing red-light cameras except in school zones, during times of speed restrictions.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I will put that money towards increasing my accessibility and presence in the community to invite more contact with constituents. I’d rather dictate the utilization of those funds then put back into the Mayor’s hands. That said, I don’t agree that City Council deserved an increase given the cost overruns, financial settlements, and general failure to place constituents over special interests in district and citywide matters. Job performance matters.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">As a civilian with only tangential access to the decisions of Chief White, and not the oversight responsibilities of sitting City Council members, it stands to reason that there are likely organizational issues that warranted some radical restructuring. It’s always a challenge to get a group to look objectively at itself to find and mitigate weaknesses and grow. The attempt is commendable, but it’s clear that there is a residual morale problem. Chief White’s stated goal is “Crime Prevention” and while I can acknowledge that has occurred generally, the 2015 uptick in gang presence, violence, and murders are evidence that there is more to be done.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">City Council has oversight responsibility on the jail. The fact that a former City Councilman, now Mayor was seen praising the Triple Crown Accreditation of the jail while legal challenges mounted is bewildering. The City Council should develop a civilian component, purely advisory, to provide perspective to the Independent Monitor in determining recourse.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">If I supported the plan, then conceptually yes, I’d consider the lodging and car rentals tax as a potential revenue source, however until I see the details of the plan, know the fate of those communities relative to the unsettled I-70 proposals and vet the cost estimating analysis that is the basis for the $850 billion price tag, I am not on board with payment plans.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">His greatest strength publicly is his charisma, and politically, the stranglehold on appointees in a strong mayor-council government such as ours.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">People should have the freedom to organize and chose to collectively bargain, including civil service employees, what matters are the results of the agreements. I think there are a lot of positions that are better compensated than similar private sector jobs, with more worker protections in place, but I recognize that someone in a civil servant position may not share that sentiment, and they should be able to negotiate as they desire.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">The sales portion is clearly working, however, there are still a lot of growing pains that must be addressed. The fact that a moratorium is in place until January is helpful for the time being, but I intend to use the time from election to the end of the year to work with stakeholders and hammer out a viable way forward from design, placement, and density of businesses, to labeling, banking, and training. There is room for improvement on all fronts.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">It’s already occurring, and it would be difficult to police some inconspicuous consumption techniques. Therefor I’d be in favor of restricting conspicuous consumption techniques (essentially those that produce second hand smoke) however we should consider allowing the restricted techniques in regulated private establishments.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I wish cigarette smokers had the common decency to just throw the butts in the trash and not on the ground. If you can go out in any weather to get a hit of nicotine, you should be able to put the remnants in a trash can. Please, just pick up after yourselves.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would prioritize neighborhood infrastructure over grandiose projects. Nothing we have done is on par with the Eiffel Tower or even Bilbao, stop chasing that dream, our location and weather are awesome enough. Let’s get the little things right, sidewalks, schools, frequent bus circulators, parks, durability, affordability, sustainability, bikes, after school art and technology opportunities, mental health and homelessness. If we lead in these areas, we will be even more memorable as a city, and an even greater place to live.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Susan K. Shepherd</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">To make northwest Denver the best place to live, work, play and raise a family.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Housing prices and rents have skyrocketed significantly in the last 2 years and many low to middle income families cannot afford to buy or rent here.  I support a dedicated revenue stream for affordable housing, which would include the construction of entry-level homes and condominiums for income-qualified residents as well as affordable rentals.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Significantly increase street and intersection safety for all users of the road, especially cyclists and pedestrians.  Would prioritize high-foot traffic areas near schools, business districts and transit stops.</p>
                <p class="answer">Continue to strengthen local business districts so we have access to more goods and services near our homes, reducing our reliance on the automobile and boosting our local economy and keeping our tax dollars in Denver, supporting our schools.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">We need to continue to increase all of our transit options in Denver to make them more accessible and convenient in order to reduce personal reliance on the automobile.  I am a champion for increased bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, and support car-share and and the re-structuring of fares to make transit more affordable and convenient.  We need more dedicated city staff to work on area parking management plans to help parking turn over more frequently for visiting customers in our business districts, and to alleviate the pressure that nearby residents feel near their homes when the available parking inventory isn't being well managed.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do not believe that there should be any more bans or restrictions passed because there are not adequate services in Denver especially downtown to help homeless individuals with their basic daily needs such as using the bathroom, taking a shower, storing their belongings or finding a place to rest their head safely at night.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes I do.  Speeding can often lead to crashes which can cause death and disability to pedestrians, cyclists, other motorists, and animals, as well as significant property damage to homes and businesses.  I live a block off Federal Blvd and see this happen all the time.  We need all the tools we can get to help calm traffic and make our streets safer for all users.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">No, but I would increase my personal giving to local non-profit organizations with operations or close ties to the district.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">There are many more reforms that need to occur.  First, there needs to be a strong body camera policy in place that covers all sworn officers regardless of rank and includes officers working off-duty.  There needs to be a strong discipline matrix in conjunction with that to enforce compliance.  I believe there should be expedited internal affairs investigations, stronger screening of new recruits to better identify anti-social and violent traits, and a much stronger system to discipline and terminate officers who find themselves repeatedly at the center of excessive force investigations.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe we need more personnel to cover the workload, better employee screening and training, and I would also support body cameras for sheriff's deputies as well.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">It seems like a good plan to raise the required revenue at this point, but I am still doing research.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think he has done a great job creating new opportunities and for youth through expanded after-school programming and creative solutions as the My Denver Card.  This can especially lift up disadvantaged youth.</p>
                <p class="question">On another hard, the Mayor seems to be somewhat risk-adverse.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Police, Fire Fighters, and Sheriffs all enjoy collective bargaining rights in Denver.  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.  If the rest of city employees would like to band together to bargain for wages, benefits and working conditions, I absolutely think they should receive equal treatment.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">For the most part I think we did a fairly decent job as the first city in the world to fully legalize recreational marijuana.  However, I think that neighborhoods should have a stronger say in determining whether a retail marijuana establishment should be allowed in their neighborhood or not.  Currently they have very little say regarding the establishment of new liquor licenses because that issue is controlled by the state.  I don't think we should make the same mistake regarding marijuana at the local level, and that is something we can decide in Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No I wouldn't support that.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would be open to considering banning tobacco smoking on the 16th Street Mall.  It might be "straw that broke the camel's back" in getting my husband to quit!  He works near the mall.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">Significantly increased budget for transportation planning and management, and for the full build-out of Denver Moves, the city's bicycle connectivity plan.</p>
                <p class="answer">More dedicated funding for affordable housing!!!</p>

                <h3 class="name">Fran Coleman</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I’m running for City Council because over the last ten years I’ve seen a general economic decline in our community.  I’ve seen small businesses replaced by big businesses and I’ve seen big businesses come and go. With each turn, it seems that more and more working families are being left behind.  While Denver’s job market is recovering, wages have remained stagnant and it has become harder and harder to pay for things like housing; the result is that basic services like public safety, transportation and park maintenance have also suffered. Even more importantly, though, is that as those basic services have suffered it has become more and more difficult to attract and foster high quality business investment. I was born in Denver and grew up in Weld County; growing up in a farm family I know the value of hard work. I have an undergraduate degree in Business Administration from Loretto Heights College, a Master Degree in Telecommunications from the University of Denver, and a Certificate in Government Contracting from the University of Phoenix. I’m the most experienced candidate because I have the best combination legislative and community experience.  I’ve lived at 2221 S. Lowell Blvd for almost 38 years and I’ve seen it change and unfortunately not for the better. I’m running for City Council District 2, because I care about its future especially its economy, its public safety, and sustaining its beauty. I’m a former State Representative for House District 1 and served from 1998 to 2006, and because of my legislative experience constituents will get results from day one. With my deep knowledge of the community I’ll be ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work immediately, for better jobs, for working families, and intelligent economic revitalization.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">District 2 needs economic solutions that assure robust diversity and competitiveness in businesses as well as revitalization of the community that ensures sustainable property values. We lost Target to the Belmar Shopping and Dining District in Lakewood, which for our community was a huge drain on the economy. The land that Target occupied in our district is not being used to its fullest potential. It is these types of areas that require collaborative solutions between business owners, government, elected officials and residents to make land redevelopment decisions that guarantee the community remains vibrant and livable.  I believe these types of depressed economic areas that are not revitalized or repurposed with community input negatively impact property values. Council District 2 should have the diversity of many walkable business, entertainment and dining choices. A section of Council District 2 is an aging community and people should have a variety of choices for shopping, dining and entertainment. In addition, public transportation should provide timely accessibility to these areas.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">If elected I would first put that question to my constituents through my Community Congress, but in general, I believe two issues of major importance are workforce development and affordable housing. I will work closely with Mayor Hancock, the Office of Economic Development, business associations, nonprofits and my constituents to attract business opportunities and bolster the southwest Denver economy.  I would place a particular focus on generating jobs through workforce initiatives that offer a clear opportunity to earn a living wage. Affordable housing is really just the economic flip side of good paying jobs in a robust, entrepreneurial and technologically driven business environment. I believe in promoting responsible, mixed use, and transit oriented development that fosters a strong sense of place as well as Denver’s long-term growth. With great consideration for existing businesses and residential neighborhoods in my district, the redevelopment and revitalization of East Colfax Avenue should be a model for southwest Denver. That model is one I would relish the opportunity to apply at specific points along Federal and Sheridan Boulevard.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Growth is inevitable; it is how we plan to deal with it that matters. My plan is to have a Community Congress that includes leaders and residents of the community. This would include business owners, land and building owners, public schools, police and fire officials, churches, homeowner groups, realtors and service providers. This congress will meet regularly with me and key city government personnel to determine the pulse, the concerns, and the needs of the community.</p>
                <p class="answer">I would work closely with stakeholders, business and residential stakeholders to identify traffic or parking hotspots and support the breadth of public transportation options (including bike lanes and clearly marked bike routes where feasible) to mitigate against traffic congestion while promoting walkable, balanced neighborhood development models.  Recognizing that parking enforcement is a strong source of revenue for the city, as parking options become scarce I would balance the need for revenue from parking against the impact to local businesses. Taking a highly targeted approach, I would support the relaxation of parking restrictions in specific neighborhoods where a balance in mixed-use residential business has already been achieved in order to make up the difference in revenue. Finally, I would work closely with private parking lot owners to identify ways to increase the supply of accessible parking, potentially through the use of parking stacks or the construction of more low profile parking structures.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe when it comes to homelessness the best thing for the City Council to do is to enforce the ordinances already on the books along with the following Specifically, I would advocate on behalf of my constituents to ensure that existing ordinances are enforced and that the municipal government is coordinating with law enforcement, human services, and nonprofits to protect Denver’s brand and help those in need. I would support the expansion of temporary housing, health and mental health services for the homeless.  I would also encourage the owners of empty buildings to work with Denver’s Road Home and other nonprofits to convert those buildings for use as temporary shelters for the homeless. I would also work with the surrounding municipalities so that Denver is coordinating  with them to better help address the issue and share the costs. In short, the more supportive services Denver is able to offer to homeless populations, the more capacity we will gain to address other, equally pressing public safety concerns.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support the current use of photo radar and red light cameras and not necessarily expansion.  As Denver grows, I would also support a focused session of our Community Congress to explore a measured expansion. However, I do not and would not support a dramatic and highly punitive expansion of the photo radar and red-light program as a major source of revenue. The nature of traffic in Denver is fluid. Often times, drivers are forced to speed up to pass or come quickly to a stop. Photo radar and red-light cameras may play a valuable role in enforcing speed restrictions and traffic flow in school zones, residential neighborhoods and accident-prone areas. However, the use of traffic enforcement technology must be balanced against the basic public interest in getting from home to work, work to home and to the many attractive destinations Denver loves. At a certain point the use of photo radar and red light cameras will begin to discourage those freedoms. I cannot fully support their use at all busy intersections and highly trafficked thoroughfares, I would also want an audit of the costs to the city for this enforcement program. We must make sure that the cost to this program meets the goals of the programs intending use.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would return the raise directly and/or donate it.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Chief White recently made the following statement about police reforms: “[Officer involved violence] is not an issue that the police department can resolve by itself. It's really a community issue that requires a partnership between the police department and the community."</p>
                <p class="answer">I agree.</p>
                <p class="answer">Police officers have very dangerous jobs. While some officers may become understandably stressed, the communities they are policing often suffer from stress of their own. In many neighborhoods a culture of poverty exacerbated by nearly ten years of increased economic hardship as well as other risk factors has not made the job of policing those communities any easier. I think it is good Chief White can see we have a need for police reform and so far the reforms he has put in place have kept  antagonisms from escalating. The ACLU of Colorado has praised Chief White for his efforts and I feel they are correct to do so. While there is always more that can be done I believe we are on the right path.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">The City Council has an important management oversight role. Patterns of abuse at our jail are not acceptable. Every suspect and every prisoner have rights. The cost of violating those rights goes beyond the payment of large court settlements. The true cost is the loss of public confidence in our justice system.  As an office holder, my first obligation is to uphold the law. As a council member, I will use every policy tool at my disposal to ensure that our laws are upheld and that justice is done. In that regard, I will actively study Denver’s jail, direct staff to analyze those problems, make constituent reports and take the recommendations of all stakeholders under consideration in order to help the Denver Sheriff’s Office, the Department of Public Safety and the Mayor’s Office determine the best path forward. If the problem is a lack of training, I will support more training. If the problem is an under-resourced office or department, I will support more resources. If the problem is the infrastructure of the jail itself, I will support improvements to the design of the facility.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">The National Western Stock Show is a gem for the city and important to our western heritage. I feel extending the lodging and car rental taxes is a good option to pay for the National Western Proposal.  I also think a public-private partnership could be a good way to raise the money as well.. Finally, I support the possibility of financing redevelopment of the National Western Stock Show site through grants from the Regional Tourism Act as well as partnerships with Colorado State University.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Hancock’s greatest strength is also his greatest weakness. As a leader Mayor Hancock strives to take a balanced, diplomatic approach to city administration. That balanced approach serves him well in most instances, but in managing issues and disputes the Mayor could be more forceful in his use of the bully pulpit to move Denver forward in some key areas:
                <ul>
                <li>Workforce & Economic Development</li>
                <li>Public Safety & Crime Prevention Policy</li>
                <li>Marijuana Legalization and Regulation</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support collective bargaining. I support it because employees should have a right to peace of mind that they can reasonably and pragmatically be able to negotiate the terms of their employment. The right to collective bargaining should include fair pay, benefits and workplace conditions. Fundamentally, employees should be able to know that they have a two-way negotiation and exchange with employers to assure that the best workplace outcomes are achieved. With collective bargaining Denver assures itself of providing quality services to its residents. As a council member I would fight for the collective bargaining rights of Denver employees</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that the regulations on the sale of recreational marijuana are working for the most part. I believe marijuana needs to continue to be strictly regulated, especially around schools. One thing I would like to see changed and thus funded is more education for young people, as well as the public, to keep them fully informed on the effects of marijuana. I also believe the moratorium on new licenses should not be extended past January 1, 2016. Retail marijuana stores should have uniform hours of operation reflective of standard hours of operation for liquor stores across the state. I would also advocate for a change in  federal law that would allow banking for retail marijuana sales, frankly in my opinion not doing so would breed crime.</p>
                <p class="answer">The marijuana industry has great potential to offer living wage jobs and to support the economic well being of Denver and Colorado. I am committed to working with the industry, the federal government, the state, City Council and my constituents to ensure that at every step public health, safety and the environment are protected as the industry develops.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">Denver should allow public consumption of marijuana but there should be some restrictions. Amendment 64, on marijuana legalization, passed overwhelmingly with 66% of the vote. Frankly, it is now the law of the state and as a city council member I would respect the will of the voters. As the industry evolves I will work to pass any enabling legislation to continue to keep marijuana legal and safe.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">No, while smoking can be troublesome and adds to environmental pollution I believe enforcement of the ordinance would be difficult.  Law enforcement resources would be better spent on the now littering ordinance to require the safe deposit of cigarettes. With finite resources we have to make sure they are used the best way possible.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">When it comes to the city budget my main concerns are that we balance the budget, make sure that we have a proper audit process in place, and to make sure we fund the vital services we need such as our law enforcement, road maintenance, and to make sure we keep our world class parks maintained and safe.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Danny F. Lopez</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I first ran for this City Council Seat in 2003 because I truly wanted to be a representative of the people and I was fed up with City Council Members complaining about their pay. That year I ran on a platform to raise the minimum wage. Citizens of Denver still do not earn a livable wage. In 2007 I got on the ballot to challenge Mayor Hickenlooper, who would have run unopposed. I wanted to make sure the Voters of Denver had an alternative choice. That election I received 10,000 alternative votes. In 2011 I ran for Mayor of Denver, in a very crowded field, I felt I owed it to the voters who voted for in 2007 to get on the ballot again. I was known as the Working Man's Representative. Running for Public Office shouldn't go to the highest bidder, the high paid executive, the entrenched governing professional official. Voters want and need a different type of candidate they can identify with, a candidate they can like. They want a candidate that will return Local Government back to the Citizens of Denver, a candidate that will SHAKE THINGS UP</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Trying to restore faith in City Government. Many citizens in Denver hate City Government they don't even vote. They are mad at Elected Officials, they are upset with Public Works, they complain about 311, They want City Government given back to the Citizens  </p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Too many parking tickets being written just to generate money for the City and upset the property owners and restoring the faith in City Government</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Research, Community input, I think you should have had some more personal questions so the voters can see and learn more about all the candidates. In every election they all make the same promises of what they are going to do (economic growth, community improvement, safety and all the other catchy promises) They get elected and nothing changes. We are all tired of the same promises and same candidates. Time to elect an alternative choice    </p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">To make sure funding for the program to end homelessness does not come out of the general fund  </p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">NO!! I am against the use of red light cameras to generate funds for the  City. What a big money grab </p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">No of course not this is the 4th  campaign I have run in. in each one I refused to take the pay raises they were getting and it seems like were always talking about pay raises for elected officials enough is enough already. Look it up I have always refused to take the raises. Matter of fact I was one of 3 people to testify against the pay raises the Mayor Cabinet received at the General Finance Committee Meeting </p>    
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">No Police moral is at a all time low the rank and file do not agree with what is taking place in the DPD When I ran for Mayor in 2011 I wanted the new chief to come from with in the department It is right to promote from with in the rank and file. </p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">Some one tell me which City Councilperson got truly upset or in any one's face about what has transpired at the County Jail No Bite in their Bark some one needs to SHAKE THINGS UP  </p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">No the free market should dictate how that program should be funded </p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">His Charismatic personality. I still haven't figured out his greatest weakness, When we ran for office in 2011 we sat next to each other a few times and I found him to be a lot of fun to be around. When he asked for my endorsement I should of asked him if I could run Public Works </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">What people fail to realize that the 40 hour work week, overtime, benefits, safety, and holidays we have, are the direct result of what Unions fought for in the 1930's and 1940's. The only way to protect worker rights, wages and benefits is thru a strong collective bargaining agreement so that City Council can not take away wages and benefits from the City Workers   I believe in a livable wage for all workers in Denver and in the benefits of collective bargaining    </p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">No I believe smokers have Rights too</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would make sure we spend our budget in the City and County of Denver. In 2011 when I ran for Mayor we talked about things being purchased from out of city and state. Nothing has changed we still buy a lot of goods from other cities and states instead of local vendors  </p>

                <h3 class="name">Aaron Greco</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I’m running for City Council because I want my daughter, Rosemary, and her peers to grow up in a diverse, sustainable, and dynamic city. The City Council plays an important role in shaping Denver’s neighborhoods into vibrant areas with multimodal transportation access, universally accessible parks and recreation, thriving artistic and cultural resources, and bustling local business districts. I want to put my diverse experience in collaborating with communities across the state at every level of government to work for the benefit of all of Denver’s citizens.</p>
                <p>As an aide to two U.S. Representatives from Colorado – Ed Perlmutter & John Salazar – I’ve worked across the state and in Washington to encourage partnerships, unify community voices, and develop policies to increase investments in public infrastructure, while preserving our most precious resources. Today, as a transportation professional, I work with Colorado communities to develop bicycle and pedestrian projects, road and bridge projects, and create greater access to a more robust public transit system.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Like most working families, young professionals, and millennials in Council District 7, our family is faced with the challenge of rising home prices and cost of living in Denver. We never thought we’d face the possibility of being priced out of our neighborhood – my wife, Tessa, and I both have great jobs – but with challenges like student loan debt, the rising cost of day care, and a crisis with housing affordability in Denver, families just like ours are looking at other options.</p>
                <p>The next City Council has the opportunity to make Denver great for generations to come. To ensure that Denver’s students, professionals, and seniors can continue living in in the city we love, we must tackle a variety of issues with forward-thinking and fiscally responsible policies. As a member of the City Council, I’ll collaborate with my colleagues and the administration to grow the supply and diversity of affordable and attainable housing options in Denver while maintaining the character of our unique neighborhoods. That means taking carefully considered action to encourage responsible density and an interconnected, multimodal transportation system that minimizes the additional strain on our congested roadways.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">District 7 has unique challenges with an interstate, a river, and several North-South arterials dividing communities. Neighborhoods like Ruby Hill and Athmar Park are in close proximity to transit hubs, but have no easy way to connect with those hubs outside of an automobile. Neighborhoods like Platt Park, Baker, West Wash Park, and Overland can’t access the South Platte River Trail safely. Any new developments along the South Platte corridor must include incentives for connectivity upgrades and investments. This can be done through a variety of means. We need a leader who will promote partnerships between multiple government jurisdictions and the private sector to achieve greater multimodal connectivity in Council District 7.</p>
                <p>Transit-oriented, multi-use density has to be promoted in areas like the former Gates Factory location, the Shattuck superfund site, the former RTD bus barn location, and other areas adjacent to light rail. These kinds of developments have the least impact on parking and congestion and are largely located in former industrial or light-industrial areas. In order to accommodate growth responsibly we’ll need to promote these areas for redevelopment.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">We are not going to be able to build enough streets and parking to get out from under congestion, let alone the increased traffic volumes that come with growth. We also can’t pull up a drawbridge and ask people to stay away from our city. Denver is inclusive and open, and it should stay that way. First, we have to maintain the transportation system that we have, which is no small feat. Corridors like Alameda west of I-25 are poorly maintained. This is partially because older infrastructure is more expensive to maintain and there are less partnership opportunities. Second, we have to make critical investments in providing multimodal options outside of the automobile. In the coming decades, it will ideally be more efficient to hop on a circulator bus, a train, a bicycle, or sidewalk than it will be to fight congestion in our cars.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would not have supported the camping ban as passed in 2012. Denver still lacks proper services and shelter space, although I applaud steps taken through Denver’s Road Home and other programs supported by the Mayor to address these needs. Giving someone seeking shelter a criminal record only makes the problem worse. Supporting our most vulnerable populations with basic services is a core function of government. I will explore the use of social impact bonds and other available financing methods to deliver the housing, addiction treatment, counseling, and training services that will bring Denver’s indigent population out of the cold. This will reduce expenditures on emergency room treatment and incarceration and save taxpayer money in the long run.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">As a transportation policy professional for CDOT, I know all too well how dangerous speeding is. For the safety of motorists, pedestrians, and workers, I support photo radar in work zones and school zones only. I won’t support any expansion of photo radar and won’t support expansion of red light cameras unless a compelling need can be demonstrated. I do believe that red light cameras are an enticement for revenue by some, but I disregard any argument made in favor of expansion related to revenue alone.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">Asking anyone to consider the merits of their paycheck in an unbiased way is impossible. A new system of automatic pay review needs to be implemented. The Career Services Authority Board, or another independent entity, should examine raises for council members and the mayor in the same way it does other city employees.</p>
                <p>I’m running for a job that will pay an eventual annual salary of $91,915. I will give a significant amount to charities that exist inside District 7, and I won’t vote for any pay increase for council members unless unbiased checks are placed on the process.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">I have concerns about some of Chief White’s reform measures like the “team approach”. Many rank-and-file cops feel that response time is delayed and safety may be jeopardized. I was incredibly impressed, however, with the implementation of body cameras, although I think work is needed to ensure that the system works properly.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">There are a number of measures we can explore to address issues at the jail that have resulted in a lack of safety for both inmates and officers. Whether flaws exist in jail design, staffing levels, training, or administration, reforms need to be made. If safety can be promoted through reconfiguration or redesign of parts of the jail, I’ll be the first one to make those recommendations, no matter the cost. I’m not interested in saving a dollar to the detriment of public safety. Period.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes. The renovated and expanded National Western will be a showcase that will bring visitors from across Colorado, the United States, and the world. In a city with more than enough demand on its scarce tax dollars, I think it’s justifiable that the very people who come to enjoy the National Western shoulder some of the burden of paying to build it. As a newly elected councilperson, however, I’d like to at least examine other uses for extended lodging tax revenues.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that Mayor Hancock’s management style is very effective. For a mayor with as much authority as Denver’s, the quality of cabinet-level mayoral appointees is critical to implementing public priorities. Having spoken with many of Denver’s staff, I know that Mayor Hancock’s deputies enjoy working for him and are given what they need to succeed. I believe he has recruited and retained a high-caliber cabinet that looks like Denver and shares our values. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to work closely with him and his administration.</p>
                <p>I’ve been pleased with some progress in his public acceptance of the cannabis industry but feel there is still some room for improvement. My hope is that he’ll be open to many of the ideas the upcoming council must consider regarding the differences between public and private consumption and extending retail hours of operation.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Collective bargaining is a legal and fundamental human right. Municipal Employees should have access to collective bargaining if they are united behind the desire to do so.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">We still have a long way to go before Denver and Colorado become the model for legalization across the U.S. That said, we’re off to a good start. We need policies that yield a safe and consistent product for consumers, a healthy business environment for producers, and an end to what remains of the black market. I support the exploration of a plant count ordinance and greater restrictions and monitoring of growing co-ops. Additionally, better coordination between city departments is needed to simplify regulatory compliance.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that the overwhelming number of voters who supported Amendment 64 were sold on a straightforward proposition: marijuana should be regulated like alcohol. I think residents and visitors in Denver should be allowed to consume marijuana in some kind of accommodation that complies with indoor clean air rules and regulations. There’s simply no use in allowing consumption by out-of-state residents without a legal option for them to do so.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Before outright bans are even considered, better management and enforcement policies should be put in place. My concern is that smoking bans are sometimes used to address problems other than the effects of second-hand smoke.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">Greater investments in Community Planning and Development and the Office of Economic Development are needed to foster a robust planning process and accommodate Denver’s unprecedented growth. A number of transportation investments should be made inside of District 7 including bike and pedestrian infrastructure spanning the South Platte River and a dedicated bike lane on Broadway.</p>
                <p>My candidacy for Denver City Council is motivated by a desire to plan a city that that is inclusive, vibrant, safe and navigable. Any budget priorities will reflect these values.</p>

                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am running for Denver City Council because I love this city and I care deeply about the future of our city and my community. As a father of two young boys, I want them to grow up in a vibrant community, a safe community and a city that will embrace their full potential. Just like my family, I want every single family in our community to experience the Denver Dream, that regardless of where you grew up, you can accomplish anything.</p>                    	
                <p>As a small business owner, I am passionate about creating an economically vibrant community, one that offers sustainable jobs and for small businesses to grow and flourish. I want to create a safe neighborhood where families can raises their children and for senior to have a place to enjoy their grandchildren. I am passionate about connecting our neighborhoods so that we can work together in order to create world class public schools, state of the art recreation centers, family friendly parks, and healthy community options for our families.</p> 
                <p>I strongly feel that local government should be easily accessible to its residents and responsive to our community’s needs. As Councilman, I will have an open door policy and continue meeting families where they are. We’ll make it easy them to communicate with our office and simply for my office to connect with them.</p>
                <p>I believe together we can accomplish anything and I have so many hopes and dreams for our community. We live in the fastest growing neighborhood in Denver, the most diverse neighborhood in Denver and with the airport in our district, it is the economic engine in the West. But our work is never done alone, that’s why I’ll need your help to accomplish our goals.</p> 
                <p>I hope you will join me and making Denver an even better city than the one we moved to, then the one we grew up in, then the one we started our businesses in and the one we raised our families in.</p>
                <p>Let’s do this together, for the future of our community, depends on all of us.</p></p>                 
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Public Safety - In order to have a community that businesses, potential homeowners, and world class and state of the art schools are willing to invest in, we must have a community that is safe for everyone. I will work closely with our police department, community leaders and colleagues to do all we can to ensure the public safety in our district.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">1. Transportation - With a fast growing community such as the one we live in, you must have a solid transportation plan for families and our seniors. We also have to ensure that families can travel in and out of the district in a fluid manner. The roads on 56th and Tower, 56th and Dunkirk, and Tower and 40th are not conducive to our growth and we must address is now!</p>
                <p>2. We must address the lack of grocery options in our neighborhood. Our community is literally feeling this and with limited options in our community, we must address this problem now!</p></p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">First, one must have an understanding of traffic engineering and how traffic planning is an integral part of urban development. Simply adding lanes and more streets does not ease congestion. In fact, it make it worse. The Down-Thomas paradox, commonly known by the triple convergence theory, states that more driving options actually induce demand. As such, it is imperative that Denver has sufficient public transportation options. This means Bus Rapid Transit, Light Rail Transit, and greater use of Transportation Oriented Development.</p>   
                <p>The goal is to not make driving easier and cheaper, or make it faster to get from A to B; our goal on city council should be to build successful communities so that A and B are located closer together. Yes, this is a radical paradigm shift that will result in the investment in and development of, our local communities. In other words the way to solve traffic congestion in Denver is with land use planning not simply traffic engineering. This falls within the realm of city council, which means that my responsibility as your next council representative for District 11 will be to build vibrant communities that are walkable and accessible. It is not under we understand the fundamental problem that we can begin to assign innovative solutions.</p></p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">We really have to strike a balance here. We need to see that the "Social Impact Bond" to provide services and housing for the homeless is followed through. We should also ensure that our police officers are trained to better deal with the homeless. </p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am open to this as long as safety is always the priority for Denver residents.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">What interests me, is that city council, according to city ordinance, must address this issue every 4 years. It was approved by the majority of council this year and I really see no reason to return the raise.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">I applaud him for listen to the community and offering some solutions that can help resolve this challenge we are having in Denver. The jury is still out on this but I think he's working hard to implement reforms needed.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">This has been a real black eye for our city but I firmly believe that Safety Director Stephanie O'Malley, the Chief of Police and Sheriff are working hard to address this concern and meeting with a great number of stakeholders throughout the city has been critical. The council should continue to give teeth to the independent monitor, like they did this past month. Our role is to not just approve settlements, in fact since 2012 we've settled a little over $10 million due to allegations of excessive force by the police and deputies. We must work diligently to fix this problem together.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think the city's plan to keep the National Western Center in Denver is a viable one; although, I would have to look further into it, I currently seen no reason to oppose it.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Mayor has ran the city now for almost 4 years. His works will and have spoken for itself and the voters will judge him off that on May 5th. I am not running for city council to be for or against our mayor but I am running to improve the lives of working families and businesses in District 11.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">"Collective bargaining is an opportunity to for a constructive dialogue to address working conditions and terms of employment. I genuinely believe in a balanced approach. That we can continue to create sustainable jobs but also respectable conversations with and for employees.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think the regulations are working for the most part; I would like for us to really get a handle on the inspections and compliance portion of the regulation. We should consider a standardized checklist so we can avoid potential duplicate inspections at the same location for multiple licenses. It’s important that we always ensure the public of its safety but I also want to make sure this isn’t too costly for the city and business.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">We should treat this the same way we treat alcohol. We don't not allow public consumption of alcohol so we should do the same for marijuana.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Not sure about Parks but on the mall there might be a possibility because of it's uniqueness. Having attended a great number of council committee hearings and full council meetings, I know that city council is currently looking at ways to address this.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I plan to look at our budget line item by line item and assess what those priorities are and what programs we might need to adjust. I plan on being hands on when it comes to our budget.</p>
