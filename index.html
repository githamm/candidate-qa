                <h3 class="name">Robin Kniech</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am running for re-election to continue the momentum and progress I have forged on affordable housing, sustainability and quality City services. I've demonstrated the value of community-led collaboration, working with communities to solve problems ranging from transforming a neglected brownfield into an open space, allowing residents to sell their own vegetables to neighbors, and ensuring new housing development in Denver includes a percentage of affordable housing. I'm running to use this same collaborative approach to help more families find affordable housing and to improve sustainability in all aspects of our daily lives, such as improving access to composting and increasing Denver's low recycling rate. At a time when a booming economy is both benefitting the city, but also challenging our infrastructure to keep up, I bring unique experience on multi-modal transportation finance and management, forged through my leadership on the Denver Union Station project and by representing Denver in the regional planning organization, Denver Regional Council of Governments.  I have both worked with, and negotiated across from developers, preparing me for the on-going challenge of ensuring growth accommodates new residents while also preserving character and improving the quality of life for existing residents and neighborhoods.</p>          
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Inaccessibly High Cost of Housing and Homelessness. While our overall economy is strong, the challenge of homelessness persists and the lack of affordable housing in our community grows worse by the day. Homelessness is a crisis for our most vulnerable residents (many of whom are families with children), and it also presents challenges for communities and business near where the homeless live on the streets without the emergency facilities they need.  Denver has saved lives and made strides by housing hundreds of homeless individuals and families, but we need to further expand daytime shelter and services while we identify new financing tools to create the permanent housing that will end homelessness for as many families as possible. I have already laid the foundation for a conversation with the Mayor and our community and am identifying possible sources of revenue Denver could dedicate to affordable housing, and if I am re-elected, I intend to bring our community together to support one of those sources for a long-term commitment to expanding affordable housing for low and moderate income families, including entry level homeownership opportunities.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">1) Multi-modal transportation and open space.  Boom and bust cycles are nothing new in the West, but Denver is seeing a frantic pace of new housing and commercial activity that is challenging our city's infrastructure. We need to be much more aggressive about creating new open spaces and transportation solutions that keep pace with this change, including thinking beyond RTD to more city-led transit efforts. If elected I will continue to build on my record in Denver and with the Denver Regional Council of Governments to prioritize multi-modal transportation plans and investment to keep up with change and growth in the city and the region.  I will also continue to advocate for city investments in new open space in existing neighborhoods, like my work in Globeville, and in-fill neighborhoods with new development where these amenities are necessary to complement higher density.</p>
                <p>2) Employment and other strategies to engage disconnected youth.  Over my first term, the city has made great strides in expanding food for hungry kids, free recreation center access and more after-school options.  But we need more targeted efforts to create connections between older teens and positive activities and opportunities.  For example, Denver needs to expand our efforts to get our teens access to summer jobs that help them earn money and develop job skills.  We have wonderful opportunities to build career pathways for young people into construction jobs we as a city create at DIA or on the National Western Center, and we should have focused apprenticeship programs to ensure we get the folks who need these opportunities the most into those training opportunities.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Described extensively above: ensuring affordable housing is a consistent component, to mitigate the increased prices new development brings; and more open space and multi-modal transportation investments to expand alternative choices to driving where density is increasing.  It is not always true that new development results in decreased parking, it just sometimes moves parking from street curbs to underground garages, so some of our work involves educating and supporting our residents to change their expectations and habits for how to park in dense areas.  In major redevelopments, we have to work hard to leverage the development itself to provide the improvements and amenities to support growth.  Where projects are smaller and more one-by-one, city investments to ensure adequate infrastructure will be necessary.  And in all cases, we need to invest in the city employees our residents call upon to plan, engineer and implement/maintain the transportation and open space we expand to support growth.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">Described extensively above: ensuring affordable housing is a consistent component, to mitigate the increased prices new development brings; and more open space and multi-modal transportation investments to expand alternative choices to driving where density is increasing.

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I have requested numerous changes in the city's next contract for camera enforcement, including:</p>
                <p>1) better/larger signage at eye level noticing people of the photo enforcement to deter speeding before citations</p>
                <p>2) use of visible real-time ""your speed is___"" at the same time as photo enforcement, so we really are focused on deterring activity, not citations, and so that when someone does get a ticket, they see right at the time what speed they were going</p>
                <p>3) specifically linking a significant portion of the revenue from photo enforcement to traffic, pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements and maintenance</p>
                <p>4) more consistent rotation of mobile enforcement throughout the city, and reduced usage in short stretches with reduced speed that are confusing for motorists</p>
                <p>With these changes, I think it is important for Denver to continue to have as many tools as possible for reducing speeds and red light violations, both of which have been responsible for numerous deaths and injuries in a city where more and more of our residents need to be able to get around safely on foot, with strollers, on bicycles or in wheelchairs.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">Given the fact that city council is a full time plus job, that the increases are on-pace with the increases provided to city employees, and they follow the formula laid out by the voters in Denver's charter, the salary set for the next council is the one I believe all members of council should be paid, including myself if I am fortunate enough to be re-elected.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Chief White has been an effective leader for change within DPD.  He has worked to redistribute scarce resources after five years of hiring freezes in ways that have brought more help to the areas of the city with the most police calls, and consistently scheduling teams to work together has resulted in more coordinated, proactive policing on special goals set based on the crime statistics in each sub-district.  We have seen a decrease in NEW use of force litigation since Chief White has been hired (many of the recent, prominent cases originated under the prior administration), and where problems continue to persist, he has taken a strong stance of zero tolerance, firing bad officers and being willing to re-examine his own policies and procedures.  We definitely have more work to do, particularly on challenging deeply held perceptions that police, like all residents, may bring to their interactions with community members.  And I expect the Chief to take many of the good suggestions that come from our Independent Monitor on how best to use Body Cameras, how to adjust our policies on shooting at moving vehicles and other important issues currently under review.  It is difficult to see some officers resist the changes the chief is making, but in some ways, as we bring on new generations of officers with more education and new energy, it is in fact his willingness to make change even in the face of some resistance, that indicates we are headed in the right direction, even though we have more work to do.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">Council has no access to confidential personnel cases and limited oversight over day to day operations in the city, where the charter assigns these duties to the Mayor.  But we have oversight powers to ask questions about policies and procedures, and to ensure that any changes requiring legislative approval are made as quickly as we become aware of them.  We also have a responsibility to ensure the staffing and supervision levels, that clearly have played a role in the challenges, are addressed before allocating funding for the budget to pay for them.  We rely greatly on the Independent Monitor to have access to confidential materials we do not, and to advise us on best practices, and I strongly supported the recent changes we made to ensure him access to the policy and data information he needs to advise us.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, this is a way to have tourism pay the way for a tourism-related project, and creatively does so by extending an existing tax rather than instituting a new one.  The city should, however, ensure that we have strong, decision-making authority in the operations of the complex, commiserate with this investment.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Hancock's strength to-date was his boldness in pursuing 2A to ensure a financially stable future for the city for generations to come. His challenge to-date has been matching his clear and evident empathy with poor and struggling moderate income residents in our city with equally far-reaching and bold solutions.  While I applaud him on supporting individual affordable housing policies and projects, at a certain point, the city must decide we have a role as a leader in challenging soaring housing prices, persistent homelessness, and wage stagnation among our working residents.  I believe he is headed in the right direction with his Housing Plan, and I believe the test of his next term will be whether he champions one or two large initiatives that really invest our city resources into supporting the most vulnerable in our community.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Collective bargaining provides a structure through which employers can work with their employees to solve challenges, and ensures employees have a voice before decisions impacting them are made. Collective bargaining doesn't mean that the city can't make cuts it has to in hard times, as has been proven with our safety departments, who consistently made sacrifices as needed during the recession.  For these reasons, I support collective bargaining, including for city employees.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes.  We have very high compliance on important issues, like no businesses being caught making sales to minors, and very few complaints from citizens to 3-1-1.  The revenue generated by the industry proves that people are moving away from the black market to retail outlets, and the revenue being generated is both covering the costs of regulation and helping to make the city better by funding general city services.  We need greater support from the state on regulating edibles to protect the safety of the public and on oversight of medical marijuana regulations.  I'm very supportive of the ordinance we are in the process of passing to outlaw unregulated grows that operate outside the retail and medical regulations, they are a danger to the public and this ordinance will greatly improve safety in our city.  </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">We should not allow public consumption in public spaces like along streets/sidewalks and parks.  I believe we will likely need to contend with some kind of permit to allow public consumption within specified venues, similar to liquor licensing, because we continue to have a challenge with where and how visitors to Denver, who do not have a private residence, can legally consume.  And we know that if we don't provide a legal, directed solution for them, then they are more likely to consume illegally in our outdoor public spaces.  But this conversation will require careful consideration and input from all stakeholders.  </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, I believe there is strong evidence that limits on smoking improve health outcomes by many smokers cutting down on their own smoking, and by reducing the unpleasant experience of involuntary second hand smoke by those who do not smoke themselves.  Whether just the Mall or all city parks is a question I would need to debate more fully with my colleagues with input from the public.  But I'm open to the conversation.  </p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">As Chair of the Council Finance committee, I believe the overall funding of various priorities is fairly well balanced right now, but we have some challenges that we need to solve:</p>
                <p>&mdash;the city currently provides no funding for new sidewalks, and given the development and multi-modal priorities outlined above, this is not sustainable and we must identify new sources, whether city funds or other sources to help provide sidewalks</p>
                <p>&mdash;we need a dedicated source of revenue for housing, we cannot just allocate a different amount of money each year, mixed-income housing developments take 2-3 years to plan and build, so there must be a long-term reliable amount that we can count on and plan for if we expect to build more affordable homes than we have to-date. Funding housing will save us money in other areas, such as social services and jail.</p>
                <p>&mdash;as described, I would dedicate revenue from photo enforcement to pedestrian, bike and traffic safety investments</p>
                <p>&mdash;we must find a way to lower the jail population, which is growing at a faster pace than predicted, to control spending on the jail, without endangering inmate or deputy safety</p>

                <p class="answer">I am running for Denver City Council at Large to bring a native voice to the Council. I have lived the boom and bust that Denver once was, and I know the challenges ahead need to be faced with a leader that understands the historical significance of Denver and the need to grow and develop. I can reconcile the growth with the needs of all communities that make up our great city and take Denver to the next level. I have worked tirelessly for over 23 years to help build a Denver that we all can be proud of. As a community activist I pushed to have laws changed, raised 20 million of dollars for education and created lasting programs that serve the poorest communities in Denver. I will bring to the Denver City Council the passion that only a native son could have. I look to build bridges, form opportunities for all residents, create smart economic growth and be a steadfast leader that will not pander to the status quo. I will be a champion for every resident. I will listen first, speak second and never waver from my values that I carry as a leader, to always build coalitions and create a unified city.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Safety reform-We need to move to have the Sherriff become an elected position and not a Mayoral appointee. Secondly, offer officers that have been on the force for over 25 years the opportunity to retire without penalty. They would receive a 1000 hours of pay as well as full benefits. Over a three year period, we would be able to bring on 300-400 new officers. We cannot fix anything with the police if we don’t change the culture that is present.</p>

                <p class="answer">Affordable and Sustainable Living</p>

                <p class="answer">Youth, Education and Social Services</p>
                <p class="answer">1. Create the infrastructure and identify the needs, opportunities and priorities that will guide families to the supportive services they need with follow up.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">We have to ensure that we meet the resident’s needs and provide for healthy growth. We all know that Denver can only grow up and over current areas. As a native, I firmly believe that we must remember the historical significances of these neighborhoods and do everything possible to balance growth with that. I would commission a committee of residents, developers, policy leaders and each would have an equal vote and input. As an educator, I have heard from many that Denver is just too expensive and is not listening to the needs and wants of the residents. Many communities are ready to burst at the seams and overdevelopment has changed some historical landscapes permanently.  The challenges of growth bring opportunity for Denver to be the city we want it to be and not just one person. That is what I will bring to the table, a voice that speaks for the community.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">We have to reconcile this and it first starts with the decriminalization of homelessness. I was a homeless teen here in Denver and it is because of supportive services that I survived. I was invested in by many in the community. We have to reinvest in our homeless, transient and couch surfers. We need to work with the mental health community to create a model that can provide the support some may need.</p>
                <p class="answer">We need to continue to partner with the shelters and social service agencies to build capacity, buy more parcels of land to provide for affordable housing and expand the services of addiction support.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">NO!</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">When I am elected I will return the  pay raise.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Chief Robert White inherited a mess but there needs to be systematic change and that comes by changing the culture. There is more to be done. I propose that officers that have been on the force for over 25 years the opportunity to retire without penalty. They would receive a 1000 hours of pay as well as full benefits. We would be able to bring in 3-4 recruit classes a year. Over a three year period, we would be able to bring on 300-400 new officers. We cannot fix anything with the police if we don’t change the culture that is present.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">We need to move to have the Sherriff become an elected position and not a Mayoral appointee. As a Councilmember at Large, this will be one of the first issues I champion. The Denver Sherriff's Department is under a huge amount of stress do to low moral, lack of accountability and leadership failures in many departments. The public needs to have full confidence in our jails and currently that is at an all time low. City Council should lead on this area because when someone dies in custody, the responsibility falls on them and the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">YES. The NWS is an institution and should be treated as such. Denver for far to long has not done a good enough job of embracing what we have and helping to build it up. There are so many opportunities that can come with a revamped NWS. It could be used as a year round attraction, as an educational center and additional convention space. The communities of Swansea, Globeville and Elyria deserve for the city to step up and provide beautification and growth that provides for the residents.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength is his dedication to the city.</p>
                <p class="answer">His greatest weakness is his tunnel vision regarding development.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">YES!</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe the regulations are working but the taxes are not fair and need to be reconsidered.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">Public consumption of marijuana should be allowed only in certain circumstances. Denver hosts many festivals where their focuses is Cannabis and the usage or celebration of. Since voting to regulate marijuana like alcohol, we have not done a great job. We need to provide a space for tourist, locals and people that can not smoke in their homes to medicate or recreate. I am in favor of smoking clubs because tourist are left to smoke in hotel rooms, on the street corners and in rental cars.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am in favor of the ban on the 16th Street Mall but not in parks. We can not govern the personal preferences of individual choices in more open public places like parks. My hope would be that the great residents of Denver would be respectful and step away from crowds and children.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">Affordable and Sustainable Living. Which include programs for self-sufficiency, homelessness and housing services.</p>
                <p class="answer">Safety and the Quality of Life for Citizens of Denver. Reform the Denver Police Department, move to have the Sherriff elected. Decrease the crime statistics in Denver by creating community partnerships with police, NRO’s, school leaders and non-profits that create comprehensive programs that work to deter crime that includes crime prevention, restorative justice and mentorship programs.</p>
                <p class="answer">Solid waste and the expansion of recycling and the compost program citywide. In order to be a World Class city we must embrace the move to reduce waste.</p>
                <p class="answer">Youth, Education and Social Services</p>
                <p class="answer">1. Create the infrastructure and identify the needs, opportunities and priorities that will guide families to the supportive services they need with follow up.</p>
                <p class="answer">2. Ensure that there is effective transparency with DHS and perform annual audits on the agency.</p>

                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">Because I believe we need people on City Council who are going to be fiscally responsible and treat taxpayer dollars as sacred and not their own private slush fund.</p>                
            	<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Housing is becoming very unaffordable in Denver right now and I would get rid of unnecessary land use regulations that are prohibiting more affordable housing units from being built.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">I would work on getting our roads paved so that they aren't destroying our cars and I would make sure Denver parks and open spaces are preserved so that Denver residents can maintain their quality of life.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would make sure the proper infrastructure is in place to handle new developments before deciding to move forward on any given project. What's the use of building a gas station it's going to take twenty minutes to turn into from an intersection?</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">People who are homeless need homes before they need anything else. Support services are just that, they don't provide homes for the homeless, nor does banning panhandling and public camping.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">No I absolutely do not. Not as a revenue generator for a City Council that can't balance a budget no matter how much money they collect.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would return raises. They was a very immoral decision on the part of every council member who voted for that. </p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">No they haven't worked, and the only thing that needs to be done is for everyone including law enforcement officers is to uphold their oath to serve and protect, not harass and neglect.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">In the Charter, City Council is responsible for oversight of the jail and should therefore do it's job of overseeing.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">As of now yes. I don't know of a better alternative and it's something that needs to be done.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">His greatest strength is that he is an incumbent with a lot of money. His greatest weakness is that a lot people see him as a puppet for developers.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">No they shouldn't. Our current employment system is just fine.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">No they're not. The high sales tax has created an even bigger black market than before. I would support repealing the ordinance that made recreational pot shops legal in Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No. It should be banned.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes. That is a place where families take their children and we should not allow our babies to inhale tobacco smoke whether indoors or outdoors.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would look into privatizing so that much needed services would be provided without costing taxpayers too much.</p>

                <p class="answer">Strengthen our economy!  We must maintain a strong economy that provides jobs and opportunity for all segments of our community.  I am working to ensure Denver residents are prepared for the jobs that will result from the public investment in reconstructing I-70, redevelopment of Brighton Blvd, and the new facilities at the National Western complex.  I have also been working with the creative industries – film/video production, visual & performing arts, etc. – to determine how the City can foster growth in this sector of our economy.</p>
                <p class="answer">The second major challenge is affordable housing. We must have a diversity of housing options and price points to attract and keep a talented workforce that is supporting the new, growing and existing businesses in our community.  We must also provide choice for baby boomers to age in place or live in non-traditional housing focused on seniors, and we need housing for families at all income levels.  At the same time we must have enough shelter beds for homeless individuals to have a safe place to rest their heads and access resources.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Prioritize efficient delivery of basic city services.  In 2012 Denver voters approved Measure 2A which provided the City with a solid tax base in order to provide basic services – public safety, parks, recreation centers, trash services and roads.  Denver severely cut city services during the recession. Now that our economy is improving and we have a solid tax base, it is time to reinvest in our infrastructure.  I am proud that we have added additional personnel to our public safety agencies and are making major investments in our roads, parks, and other facilities.  Public safety also includes our fire department and emergency response capacities and I have been devoting particular attention to hazmat by rail safety.   I will continue to focus on and support the development of programs like the implementation of the Solid Waste Master Plan that moves the City towards a single, and less costly, system of trash collection from the three systems we support today.</p>
                <p class="answer">Protect the quality of life in Denver.  The rapid growth we are seeing coming out of the recession is putting added stress on the areas of dense development and our transportation networks from major highways to arterial roads and even residential streets.  We need to address the added growth, transportation and transit needs in ways that maintain the character of communities and the city as a whole that have always made Denver such a desirable place to live, work and raise our families.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Some of the very neighborhoods that are already parking challenged need to be involved in the conversation so the implementation results in a balance between ensuring parking is available for customers who come from outside the area and enough bike racks and safe bike lanes for neighbors from nearby neighborhoods to also patronize local businesses.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">The issue of homelessness is complicated.  To help the chronic homeless we must address the underlying mental health issues that result in people living on the streets.  We also must make sure there is a sufficient shelter space and day service to reduce conflict with the nearby residents or businesses.  At the same time, we must support construction of housing that is affordable to prevent families from being displaced and becoming homeless.  I don’t have a magic wand that will solve the issue.  I do have experience as a member and chairman of the board of Del Norte Neighborhood Development Corporation and as the first executive director of Denver’s Homeless Commission providing shelter, services and housing for homeless and low-income residents.  Denver must identify a stable source of funding for development of affordable housing and partnerships to provide needed services.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support Denver’s red light cameras and photo radar because it slows traffic down and has reduced accidents.  My own experience is that these keep me and other drivers, aware of the need to be vigilant in driving safely.  They are not that hard to avoid; just don’t speed or run red lights, especially given our increased vehicle, pedestrian and bike traffic.  They free up police resources to be handling other matters, but I also support having police on the street to help keep our ever-more-crowded roads safer.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I voted to adjust the salaries for all elected official positions for the next four-year term, same as City Council has historically done at the end of a term - for the incoming elected leaders.  The City Charter governs how pay raises for elected officials are set - in fact - the voters approved this newer method during the Hickenlooper administration.   This is done every four years using a set formula along with data researched by Denver’s Human Resource Department.  A seated council cannot vote itself a raise.  We recently voted an increase for the next city council that will take office in July, and the pay will not be increased again until 2019.  I am open to a discussion about changing the charter provisions.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">There is more to be done to change long term culture problems in police conduct here and elsewhere in the country, while giving our officers the support they need to do the dangerous work of protecting the public and fostering mutual respect between the police and the community. I also firmly believe that our emergency responders who frequently deal with horrific incidents in our community should be provided counseling for PTSD.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">An extensive internal and external review of the department is underway that may result in policy recommendations requiring city council approval. Whether someone is in jail pending trial or has been found guilty of a crime, they must be treated fairly and justly.  This environment requires a balanced approach to allow our officers to do their job and I look forward to receiving the results of the review and working with the departments and community to make changes that will assure the consistent, humane treatment of inmates while also providing our employees with a safe working environment.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">There needs to be much more public discussion and dialogue prior to deciding if this is the best way to fund the redevelopment of the National Western complex. Many more details need to be provided including the ownership structure for the new complex and the governance structure.  I am excited about the opportunities redevelopment for improving the long-neglected neighborhoods Globeville, Swansea and Elyria.  We must make sure that the infrastructure needs of these neighborhoods are not neglected as we rebuild the National Western Complex and I-70 is reconstructed.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Hancock’s greatest strength has been articulating goals for the City, such as the Office of Ec. Development’s Jumpstart Denver, Denver Moves pedestrian and bicycle master plan and a housing plan that should be formally adopted by City Council  There will be at least 5, and as many as 10, new council members after the election.  His biggest challenge will be to establish a collaborative working relationship with the new Council and to get Adams County and Denver on the same page about changes to DIA’s IGA.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am supportive of establishing collective bargaining for city employees that balances worker rights with public safety considerations.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe Denver has tackled the issues surrounding legal recreational and medical marijuana well.  We worked diligently with all interested parties/groups to implement the will of the voters and address issues of specific concern to Denver within the state and constitutional framework.  There are, however, still challenges especially with the industries’ inability to open bank accounts and how our program is implemented as to the public, our communities and the regulated industry.  Council recently adopted new ordinances to address health and safety issues caused by alcohol-based hash oil processing and large unregulated grow operations.  I think our laws and rules need to change as new issues arise and the industry evolves.  My focus throughout this process has been, and will continue to be, on limiting access to marijuana by children.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No.  Open and public consumption of marijuana is prohibited by Amendment 64. The Amendment states, “. . . nothing in this section shall permit consumption that is conducted openly and publicly or in a manner that endangers others.”</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would tend to lean in support: however I would want to have a better sense of what the public wants and full opportunity for the public to weigh in as to particular no-smoking zones, such as the 16th Street Mall, parts of parks or certain types of parks.  We should keep in mind Denver has over 5,000 acres of urban parks plus 14,000 acres of mountain parks which, in particular, may need smoking bans in times of high fire hazard. I also don’t want to give expectations that Denver will have the where-with-all in staffing to enforce such a law if passed in all parks (including Mtn. parks) and I am very sensitive to another punitive law towards homeless individuals before we have the 24 hour rest and resource center promised when the no camping ban was adopted.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe we need to invest in infrastructure that will increase the walkability and bikeability of our city.  A number of areas of the City are lacking or have decaying infrastructure such as roads in disrepair and sidewalks.  Many of these areas are on major roads where people walk and catch the bus. I think we need to commit more resources to meeting these needs and to assuring our streets are safe for cyclists and as well as motorists.  Another example is that we are building pedestrian bridges to provide access to transit. We need to make sure we can keep them useable through the winter months.  Whether these needs are funded through annual appropriations or a designated funding stream is currently under discussion.</p>
                <p class="answer">I will continue to work on insuring that the neighborhoods of Globeville, Elyria and Swansea receive the community benefits they have asked for in their recently adopted neighborhood plans and comments to the I-70 Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) and on the National Western Center, both of which will have significant impacts to their community, yet pose incredible opportunities for these neighborhoods.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Kayvan Khalatbari</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">Because I love this city and see it getting away from its values and what has made it great as we deal with this incredible transition and growth period.  I will provide an incredibly different perspective than any of our current City Council members as I have more business experience than all of them combined and more philanthropic experience than any one of them that doesn't revolve around a photo opportunity.  I couldn't care less for special interests, the status quo or assuming that just because we've done something in the past that it needs to continue being done that way.  We are rapidly evolving as a city and need folks who think truly progressively, something our current Council appears incapable of.  I went from homeless 7 years ago to having seven local businesses that employ about 100 people, are community-driven to the max and engage in and understand the problems of the people we surround ourselves with.  I'm a real person.</p>	                   
            	<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Affordable housing in our city's core because of the free pass our current City Council and Mayor have given developers to run amok and ignore this issue without repercussion.  This issue creates many of the others plaguing our city as they relate to far fewer purchasable properties that keep people from home ownership, public transportation inadequacies and too many cars on the road as more and more people are required to move into the suburbs and make their way into the city each day, stagnant wages and a loss of many artistic and creative opportunities in our city core that can't afford to exist any more. </p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Access for children to creative, artistic, thought-based and entrepreneurial services after school.  While Mayor Hancock made recreational centers available for free to DPS students, physical activity isn't going to provide our youth an opportunity to excel in life and understand that there are bigger and better things out there for them.  Our public schools are in shambles with an outdated curriculum and lack of funding to support the great teachers we have within them.  As hard as we will need to work to fix that issue, and we will try, I think we can provide other services to kids in these other disciplines to engage them constructively and do so with many of our existing private foundations, organizations and entities and without costing the city much, if anything.  Obviously to get kids to these services will require transportation, something lacking for many low-income families, but I have some great public and private ideas here as well to bridge this gap.</p>
                <p>While public transportation and our out of control police force are towards the top of my list, I don't just come to the table with solutions for existing issues, but rather solutions for future issues that aren't apparent problems yet, or at least aren't noticed by the general public yet.  We need someone in Council with some foresight and not simply a reactive mindset.  I think establishing the epicenter of our nation's hemp economy in Denver is the most impactful thing we can do as a city right now.  This is an industry that is about to take off in a big way on an international level, will be 100x larger than medical or social cannabis, less controversial than both of those and a foundation for a truly local economy, something I believe is the solution to many of our existing problems locally and nationally.  We are already legally growing hemp in this state, but it hasn't taken off because we don't have the processing facilities available here or anywhere else in the country because of our Federal government's ignorant association with this plant to cannabis.  If we build these processing facilities here in Denver, production of hemp will expand across Colorado and we will create tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of economic development, all of it sitting on the table right now just waiting.  I can and will bring the money in to get this done and have this plan come to fruition during my Council term.  We will then be far less reliant on international and national sources for food, textiles, fuel, construction materials and on and on.  We can create a truly local and self-sufficient community.  Let's be the progressive example and guiding light for hemp as we have for medical and social use cannabis.</p></p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">By not allowing restaurants and bars to be piled up on one another in our wonderful and eclectic neighborhoods.  As an example, allowing places like Punch Bowl Social to inhabit a neighborhood like Baker on Broadway have done that neighborhood a huge disservice.  I own a business in the neighborhood and know hundreds and hundreds of constituents who work and live the area who agree with me.  Parking is becoming non-existent, crime is up and we've lost the opportunity for more necessary services to go into that space since they opened. Examples like this exist all over the city.  Where is the push for more local and organic markets and non-booze-fueled modes of entertainment that families and the rest of us can enjoy in our neighborhoods?  Why are we being forced to leave our own neighborhoods to be entertained while alcohol and traffic issues continue to erode our community fabric?  Local, neighborhood economies.  It's really that simple.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">To say that homelessness is a crime is an abomination and our current Council and Mayor should be ashamed of themselves for pushing for that definition.  It's a public health issue that needs real solutions at the root of the problem, not some tired attempt to cover it up.  Lack of affordable housing and access to harm reduction services for drug addicts are the two main perpetuators of this problem and the City has done little more than nothing to provide support to correcting this.  They've given developers a free pass to ignore the construction of low-mid-income housing and the ability for people to purchase properties and establish roots in our community.  They've provided nothing in the way of support to harm reduction programs to finally start viewing drug addiction as a public health issue and not a crime.  We are creating our own cycles of homelessness by our failed and archaic policies on these two issues.  I've already pledged to donate half of my Council salary to the Harm Reduction Center and the rest will soon be earmarked for other progressive groups that are working on creating these solutions. If our current elected officials don't feel this is a priority, I will do what I can to tackle it myself, and not vote to give myself the maximum raise as this current Council and both my incumbent competitors just did. </p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">Heck no.  These things are downright criminal and do nothing to improve public safety.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">Per my comments above, I have already pledged to donate half of my salary to the Harm Reduction Action Center, with the other half to be given away soon to local and deserving progressives in our community.  Not only did our current Council provide the maximum raise to themselves, they kept that decision out of the hands of Denver voters. Abhorable.  I am running for office as a public service, not to bankroll a comfy lifestyle or to pursue future political aspirations.  A true democracy is driven by people with varied life/business experiences, not career politicians looking to benefit their bottom line.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">While the police force appears to have made strides to increase their levels of compassion and accountability within their ranks, we need to do more.  I think the city would benefit greatly from more peace officers capable of mediating and integrating with our communities and less police officers roaming our city streets.  Don't take this as me saying I want police gone, because that is far from the case.  I just think we use their services in many environments where they don't provide a benefit and we end up wasting taxpayer money and coming across as a militaristic and lacking in compassion. The utilization of peace officers means more jobs, more watchful eyes on the streets, a better relationship with our communities and getting these folks back to being public servants and not instigators of $10+ million gone in lawsuits for police brutality and misuse of power.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think pushing for sensible reform in drug policy and homelessness would be a great start.  If people aren't thrown in jails for public health issues it becomes harder to abuse them in jails.  Aside from that though, more accountability and less militaristic ideals with all our police and prison staff.  Bad apples need to be removed from the police force and held accountable legally, not given paid time off and a slap on the wrist for gross misuses of power.  It's all about creating a culture shift and that starts with providing examples of very real consequences of action.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">I'm not opposed, but I think other options should always be looked at to perhaps supplement this revenue.  This is a massive state and regional benefit and it would seem outsiders should do some chipping in as well.  We're also proposing giving back a large sum of cannabis tax money, much of it earned from tourists.  Why not either repurpose this money or lower those taxes?</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">They are one in the same, the fact that he is out of touch.  Unfortunately it makes his strength only an asset for him and a liability for this city.  His isolation and unwillingness to engage in a real way has kept him out of touch with the needs of the communities he should be serving, yet close to developer cronies who are funding his reelection without any true competition to hold him accountable.  I think he's wrong for Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am not opposed to the discussion of collective bargaining rights for civil service employees.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">Of course they are, but they can be better.  We've seen domestic violence and traffic fatalities go down, as well as teen use.  We've seen tax revenue generated to the point that we are talking about giving it back to taxpayers and we've seen more and more studies show that these businesses reduce crime in the areas they inhabit.  The main issue that needs to be addressed is operating hours and extending these from 7pm to 10pm for retail cannabis stores in Denver.  Most municipalities surrounding Denver allow these stores to be open until 10pm, which forces people in Denver to either drive a distance or buy on the black market after 7pm.  All this while alcohol sales are allowed until midnight, a drug that kills 1 in 7 working age Coloradans according to the CDC.  Why not allow our residents similar access to the SAFER alternative?  Let's not forget the economic value being lost here and not just in the millions in tax revenue being shipped outside this city.  With 150-200 cannabis dispensaries in Denver, each with 5-10 employees onsite at any given time, those additional three hours of operation each day are losing this city thousands of labor hours each and every day, for no logical reason.  The sky never fell, folks.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, of course.  The intent of Amendment 64 was to equalize cannabis with alcohol.  The inability of folks to legally consume is creating an epidemic with regard to public consumption tickets being issued and a conundrum for tourists.  It is foolish to tell millions of people around the world that it is legal to purchase cannabis in this state, but not give them an opportunity to legally consume it here.  Hotels are predominantly owned by large chains that disallow it all together.  Boutique hotels have come on board to try and address this issue but haven't made a dent because the Colorado Clean Indoor Air Act greatly limits the number of rooms that can allow smoking.  While I don't believe cannabis cafes are the solution, there needs to be some consideration for incorporating this use into existing venues.  I believe additional restricted licenses should be available to existing bars and venues that designate interior spaces for the vaporizing of cannabis and designated outdoor areas where tobacco smoking is allowed to be used for the combustion of cannabis plant material.  I believe this solution integrates this use into our existing city fabric much more responsibly than cannabis cafes, which segregate these users and perpetuate stereotypes that simply aren't true.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I'm torn on this issue.  I don't believe government should be in control of an issue like this, but also understand the concerns associated with wanting to do it.  I need to speak with all stakeholders (business owners, city officials, residents and tourists) more to make an informed decision.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I really love what Denver has done with their Arts & Venues Department, creating a self-funded entity that is reliant on itself to be efficient with the use of its money and make good decisions with it because the alternative is the inability to function.  More accountability for how money is spent and incorporating a traditional business practices to balancing cash flow would go a long way and reduce the necessity for perpetually rising taxes.  As someone who has more business experience than all folks currently in City Council and our Mayor combined, I have zero reason to believe I can't bring from more sustainable business practices to how we raise and spend our money.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Rafael Espinoza</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">The economy has put tremendous pressure on Northwest Denver’s character and infrastructure these last 4 years. The people have found my opponent non-responsive and incapable of dealing with these comprehensive challenges effectively. I have a 16-year history of providing community-centric solutions in my North Denver neighborhood, so stakeholders asked me to serve as North Denver’s City Councilperson because of my problem solving skills, professional competency, and record of commitment to the people of Northwest Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">The biggest challenge is destabilizing development that threatens the opportunity and character that make Northwest Denver so desirable to the people that continue to make it home. I would use the office of City Council to shape development, manage growth through place-making, direct more resources into local infrastructure solutions, and proactively work with DPS to capitalize on opportunities to deliver neighborhood-based education in Northwest Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Parking and traffic, like many of the issues facing the district, these too, are development related. The zoning code is developer-friendly regarding open space and parking requirements, both result in increased density, less off-street parking and more cars on the road. The zoning code largely overlooks the existing fabric and infrastructure. Deference to the existing fabric must be codified to some degree to maintain the quality of life that has served Northwest Denver communities for over 100-years; empirically our area has proven to be sustainable model.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">My approach would be to raise traffic and parking issues every time the intensity of use goes up on sizable projects. I’d establish specific criteria for parking and traffic studies that go beyond the normally abbreviated areas. Often, known failing intersections are omitted from traffic studies to avoid shedding light on a problem, I understand these issues enough to know what to question.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">The money spent and the measures taken haven’t solved the problem. Rather than perpetually kicking the can down the road, I would advance a package of solutions to address the panoply of reasons behind the homeless issue to improve outcomes for the homeless and improve quality of life in Denver. These concepts will be developed to be revenue neutral and will take more than passionate pleas when voting in the minority, but rather creativity, political will, and diplomacy in garnering support city-wide, and on Council, to see them to fruition.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do not support photo speed enforcement, but I partially support red-light cameras. Considering the potential consequences of running red lights, and the general regularity with which it is done, enforcing the running of red lights is a worthwhile endeavor. The fines should begin low, then structured and weighted towards penalizing habitual offenders. However, I do not support stop-line enforcement utilizing red-light cameras except in school zones, during times of speed restrictions.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I will put that money towards increasing my accessibility and presence in the community to invite more contact with constituents. I’d rather dictate the utilization of those funds then put back into the Mayor’s hands. That said, I don’t agree that City Council deserved an increase given the cost overruns, financial settlements, and general failure to place constituents over special interests in district and citywide matters. Job performance matters.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">As a civilian with only tangential access to the decisions of Chief White, and not the oversight responsibilities of sitting City Council members, it stands to reason that there are likely organizational issues that warranted some radical restructuring. It’s always a challenge to get a group to look objectively at itself to find and mitigate weaknesses and grow. The attempt is commendable, but it’s clear that there is a residual morale problem. Chief White’s stated goal is “Crime Prevention” and while I can acknowledge that has occurred generally, the 2015 uptick in gang presence, violence, and murders are evidence that there is more to be done.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">City Council has oversight responsibility on the jail. The fact that a former City Councilman, now Mayor was seen praising the Triple Crown Accreditation of the jail while legal challenges mounted is bewildering. The City Council should develop a civilian component, purely advisory, to provide perspective to the Independent Monitor in determining recourse.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">If I supported the plan, then conceptually yes, I’d consider the lodging and car rentals tax as a potential revenue source, however until I see the details of the plan, know the fate of those communities relative to the unsettled I-70 proposals and vet the cost estimating analysis that is the basis for the $850 billion price tag, I am not on board with payment plans.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">His greatest strength publicly is his charisma, and politically, the stranglehold on appointees in a strong mayor-council government such as ours.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">People should have the freedom to organize and chose to collectively bargain, including civil service employees, what matters are the results of the agreements. I think there are a lot of positions that are better compensated than similar private sector jobs, with more worker protections in place, but I recognize that someone in a civil servant position may not share that sentiment, and they should be able to negotiate as they desire.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">The sales portion is clearly working, however, there are still a lot of growing pains that must be addressed. The fact that a moratorium is in place until January is helpful for the time being, but I intend to use the time from election to the end of the year to work with stakeholders and hammer out a viable way forward from design, placement, and density of businesses, to labeling, banking, and training. There is room for improvement on all fronts.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">It’s already occurring, and it would be difficult to police some inconspicuous consumption techniques. Therefor I’d be in favor of restricting conspicuous consumption techniques (essentially those that produce second hand smoke) however we should consider allowing the restricted techniques in regulated private establishments.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I wish cigarette smokers had the common decency to just throw the butts in the trash and not on the ground. If you can go out in any weather to get a hit of nicotine, you should be able to put the remnants in a trash can. Please, just pick up after yourselves.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would prioritize neighborhood infrastructure over grandiose projects. Nothing we have done is on par with the Eiffel Tower or even Bilbao, stop chasing that dream, our location and weather are awesome enough. Let’s get the little things right, sidewalks, schools, frequent bus circulators, parks, durability, affordability, sustainability, bikes, after school art and technology opportunities, mental health and homelessness. If we lead in these areas, we will be even more memorable as a city, and an even greater place to live.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Susan K. Shepherd</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">To make northwest Denver the best place to live, work, play and raise a family.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Housing prices and rents have skyrocketed significantly in the last 2 years and many low to middle income families cannot afford to buy or rent here.  I support a dedicated revenue stream for affordable housing, which would include the construction of entry-level homes and condominiums for income-qualified residents as well as affordable rentals.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Significantly increase street and intersection safety for all users of the road, especially cyclists and pedestrians.  Would prioritize high-foot traffic areas near schools, business districts and transit stops.</p>
                <p class="answer">Continue to strengthen local business districts so we have access to more goods and services near our homes, reducing our reliance on the automobile and boosting our local economy and keeping our tax dollars in Denver, supporting our schools.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">We need to continue to increase all of our transit options in Denver to make them more accessible and convenient in order to reduce personal reliance on the automobile.  I am a champion for increased bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, and support car-share and and the re-structuring of fares to make transit more affordable and convenient.  We need more dedicated city staff to work on area parking management plans to help parking turn over more frequently for visiting customers in our business districts, and to alleviate the pressure that nearby residents feel near their homes when the available parking inventory isn't being well managed.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do not believe that there should be any more bans or restrictions passed because there are not adequate services in Denver especially downtown to help homeless individuals with their basic daily needs such as using the bathroom, taking a shower, storing their belongings or finding a place to rest their head safely at night.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes I do.  Speeding can often lead to crashes which can cause death and disability to pedestrians, cyclists, other motorists, and animals, as well as significant property damage to homes and businesses.  I live a block off Federal Blvd and see this happen all the time.  We need all the tools we can get to help calm traffic and make our streets safer for all users.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">No, but I would increase my personal giving to local non-profit organizations with operations or close ties to the district.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">There are many more reforms that need to occur.  First, there needs to be a strong body camera policy in place that covers all sworn officers regardless of rank and includes officers working off-duty.  There needs to be a strong discipline matrix in conjunction with that to enforce compliance.  I believe there should be expedited internal affairs investigations, stronger screening of new recruits to better identify anti-social and violent traits, and a much stronger system to discipline and terminate officers who find themselves repeatedly at the center of excessive force investigations.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe we need more personnel to cover the workload, better employee screening and training, and I would also support body cameras for sheriff's deputies as well.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">It seems like a good plan to raise the required revenue at this point, but I am still doing research.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think he has done a great job creating new opportunities and for youth through expanded after-school programming and creative solutions as the My Denver Card.  This can especially lift up disadvantaged youth.</p>
                <p class="question">On another hard, the Mayor seems to be somewhat risk-adverse.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Police, Fire Fighters, and Sheriffs all enjoy collective bargaining rights in Denver.  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.  If the rest of city employees would like to band together to bargain for wages, benefits and working conditions, I absolutely think they should receive equal treatment.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">For the most part I think we did a fairly decent job as the first city in the world to fully legalize recreational marijuana.  However, I think that neighborhoods should have a stronger say in determining whether a retail marijuana establishment should be allowed in their neighborhood or not.  Currently they have very little say regarding the establishment of new liquor licenses because that issue is controlled by the state.  I don't think we should make the same mistake regarding marijuana at the local level, and that is something we can decide in Denver.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No I wouldn't support that.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would be open to considering banning tobacco smoking on the 16th Street Mall.  It might be "straw that broke the camel's back" in getting my husband to quit!  He works near the mall.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">Significantly increased budget for transportation planning and management, and for the full build-out of Denver Moves, the city's bicycle connectivity plan.</p>
                <p class="answer">More dedicated funding for affordable housing!!!</p>

                <h3 class="name">Fran Coleman</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I’m running for City Council because over the last ten years I’ve seen a general economic decline in our community.  I’ve seen small businesses replaced by big businesses and I’ve seen big businesses come and go. With each turn, it seems that more and more working families are being left behind.  While Denver’s job market is recovering, wages have remained stagnant and it has become harder and harder to pay for things like housing; the result is that basic services like public safety, transportation and park maintenance have also suffered. Even more importantly, though, is that as those basic services have suffered it has become more and more difficult to attract and foster high quality business investment. I was born in Denver and grew up in Weld County; growing up in a farm family I know the value of hard work. I have an undergraduate degree in Business Administration from Loretto Heights College, a Master Degree in Telecommunications from the University of Denver, and a Certificate in Government Contracting from the University of Phoenix. I’m the most experienced candidate because I have the best combination legislative and community experience.  I’ve lived at 2221 S. Lowell Blvd for almost 38 years and I’ve seen it change and unfortunately not for the better. I’m running for City Council District 2, because I care about its future especially its economy, its public safety, and sustaining its beauty. I’m a former State Representative for House District 1 and served from 1998 to 2006, and because of my legislative experience constituents will get results from day one. With my deep knowledge of the community I’ll be ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work immediately, for better jobs, for working families, and intelligent economic revitalization.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">District 2 needs economic solutions that assure robust diversity and competitiveness in businesses as well as revitalization of the community that ensures sustainable property values. We lost Target to the Belmar Shopping and Dining District in Lakewood, which for our community was a huge drain on the economy. The land that Target occupied in our district is not being used to its fullest potential. It is these types of areas that require collaborative solutions between business owners, government, elected officials and residents to make land redevelopment decisions that guarantee the community remains vibrant and livable.  I believe these types of depressed economic areas that are not revitalized or repurposed with community input negatively impact property values. Council District 2 should have the diversity of many walkable business, entertainment and dining choices. A section of Council District 2 is an aging community and people should have a variety of choices for shopping, dining and entertainment. In addition, public transportation should provide timely accessibility to these areas.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">If elected I would first put that question to my constituents through my Community Congress, but in general, I believe two issues of major importance are workforce development and affordable housing. I will work closely with Mayor Hancock, the Office of Economic Development, business associations, nonprofits and my constituents to attract business opportunities and bolster the southwest Denver economy.  I would place a particular focus on generating jobs through workforce initiatives that offer a clear opportunity to earn a living wage. Affordable housing is really just the economic flip side of good paying jobs in a robust, entrepreneurial and technologically driven business environment. I believe in promoting responsible, mixed use, and transit oriented development that fosters a strong sense of place as well as Denver’s long-term growth. With great consideration for existing businesses and residential neighborhoods in my district, the redevelopment and revitalization of East Colfax Avenue should be a model for southwest Denver. That model is one I would relish the opportunity to apply at specific points along Federal and Sheridan Boulevard.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Growth is inevitable; it is how we plan to deal with it that matters. My plan is to have a Community Congress that includes leaders and residents of the community. This would include business owners, land and building owners, public schools, police and fire officials, churches, homeowner groups, realtors and service providers. This congress will meet regularly with me and key city government personnel to determine the pulse, the concerns, and the needs of the community.</p>
                <p class="answer">I would work closely with stakeholders, business and residential stakeholders to identify traffic or parking hotspots and support the breadth of public transportation options (including bike lanes and clearly marked bike routes where feasible) to mitigate against traffic congestion while promoting walkable, balanced neighborhood development models.  Recognizing that parking enforcement is a strong source of revenue for the city, as parking options become scarce I would balance the need for revenue from parking against the impact to local businesses. Taking a highly targeted approach, I would support the relaxation of parking restrictions in specific neighborhoods where a balance in mixed-use residential business has already been achieved in order to make up the difference in revenue. Finally, I would work closely with private parking lot owners to identify ways to increase the supply of accessible parking, potentially through the use of parking stacks or the construction of more low profile parking structures.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe when it comes to homelessness the best thing for the City Council to do is to enforce the ordinances already on the books along with the following Specifically, I would advocate on behalf of my constituents to ensure that existing ordinances are enforced and that the municipal government is coordinating with law enforcement, human services, and nonprofits to protect Denver’s brand and help those in need. I would support the expansion of temporary housing, health and mental health services for the homeless.  I would also encourage the owners of empty buildings to work with Denver’s Road Home and other nonprofits to convert those buildings for use as temporary shelters for the homeless. I would also work with the surrounding municipalities so that Denver is coordinating  with them to better help address the issue and share the costs. In short, the more supportive services Denver is able to offer to homeless populations, the more capacity we will gain to address other, equally pressing public safety concerns.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support the current use of photo radar and red light cameras and not necessarily expansion.  As Denver grows, I would also support a focused session of our Community Congress to explore a measured expansion. However, I do not and would not support a dramatic and highly punitive expansion of the photo radar and red-light program as a major source of revenue. The nature of traffic in Denver is fluid. Often times, drivers are forced to speed up to pass or come quickly to a stop. Photo radar and red-light cameras may play a valuable role in enforcing speed restrictions and traffic flow in school zones, residential neighborhoods and accident-prone areas. However, the use of traffic enforcement technology must be balanced against the basic public interest in getting from home to work, work to home and to the many attractive destinations Denver loves. At a certain point the use of photo radar and red light cameras will begin to discourage those freedoms. I cannot fully support their use at all busy intersections and highly trafficked thoroughfares, I would also want an audit of the costs to the city for this enforcement program. We must make sure that the cost to this program meets the goals of the programs intending use.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would return the raise directly and/or donate it.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Chief White recently made the following statement about police reforms: “[Officer involved violence] is not an issue that the police department can resolve by itself. It's really a community issue that requires a partnership between the police department and the community."</p>
                <p class="answer">I agree.</p>
                <p class="answer">Police officers have very dangerous jobs. While some officers may become understandably stressed, the communities they are policing often suffer from stress of their own. In many neighborhoods a culture of poverty exacerbated by nearly ten years of increased economic hardship as well as other risk factors has not made the job of policing those communities any easier. I think it is good Chief White can see we have a need for police reform and so far the reforms he has put in place have kept  antagonisms from escalating. The ACLU of Colorado has praised Chief White for his efforts and I feel they are correct to do so. While there is always more that can be done I believe we are on the right path.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">The City Council has an important management oversight role. Patterns of abuse at our jail are not acceptable. Every suspect and every prisoner have rights. The cost of violating those rights goes beyond the payment of large court settlements. The true cost is the loss of public confidence in our justice system.  As an office holder, my first obligation is to uphold the law. As a council member, I will use every policy tool at my disposal to ensure that our laws are upheld and that justice is done. In that regard, I will actively study Denver’s jail, direct staff to analyze those problems, make constituent reports and take the recommendations of all stakeholders under consideration in order to help the Denver Sheriff’s Office, the Department of Public Safety and the Mayor’s Office determine the best path forward. If the problem is a lack of training, I will support more training. If the problem is an under-resourced office or department, I will support more resources. If the problem is the infrastructure of the jail itself, I will support improvements to the design of the facility.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">The National Western Stock Show is a gem for the city and important to our western heritage. I feel extending the lodging and car rental taxes is a good option to pay for the National Western Proposal.  I also think a public-private partnership could be a good way to raise the money as well.. Finally, I support the possibility of financing redevelopment of the National Western Stock Show site through grants from the Regional Tourism Act as well as partnerships with Colorado State University.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Hancock’s greatest strength is also his greatest weakness. As a leader Mayor Hancock strives to take a balanced, diplomatic approach to city administration. That balanced approach serves him well in most instances, but in managing issues and disputes the Mayor could be more forceful in his use of the bully pulpit to move Denver forward in some key areas:
                <ul>
                <li>Workforce & Economic Development</li>
                <li>Public Safety & Crime Prevention Policy</li>
                <li>Marijuana Legalization and Regulation</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support collective bargaining. I support it because employees should have a right to peace of mind that they can reasonably and pragmatically be able to negotiate the terms of their employment. The right to collective bargaining should include fair pay, benefits and workplace conditions. Fundamentally, employees should be able to know that they have a two-way negotiation and exchange with employers to assure that the best workplace outcomes are achieved. With collective bargaining Denver assures itself of providing quality services to its residents. As a council member I would fight for the collective bargaining rights of Denver employees</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that the regulations on the sale of recreational marijuana are working for the most part. I believe marijuana needs to continue to be strictly regulated, especially around schools. One thing I would like to see changed and thus funded is more education for young people, as well as the public, to keep them fully informed on the effects of marijuana. I also believe the moratorium on new licenses should not be extended past January 1, 2016. Retail marijuana stores should have uniform hours of operation reflective of standard hours of operation for liquor stores across the state. I would also advocate for a change in  federal law that would allow banking for retail marijuana sales, frankly in my opinion not doing so would breed crime.</p>
                <p class="answer">The marijuana industry has great potential to offer living wage jobs and to support the economic well being of Denver and Colorado. I am committed to working with the industry, the federal government, the state, City Council and my constituents to ensure that at every step public health, safety and the environment are protected as the industry develops.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">Denver should allow public consumption of marijuana but there should be some restrictions. Amendment 64, on marijuana legalization, passed overwhelmingly with 66% of the vote. Frankly, it is now the law of the state and as a city council member I would respect the will of the voters. As the industry evolves I will work to pass any enabling legislation to continue to keep marijuana legal and safe.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">No, while smoking can be troublesome and adds to environmental pollution I believe enforcement of the ordinance would be difficult.  Law enforcement resources would be better spent on the now littering ordinance to require the safe deposit of cigarettes. With finite resources we have to make sure they are used the best way possible.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">When it comes to the city budget my main concerns are that we balance the budget, make sure that we have a proper audit process in place, and to make sure we fund the vital services we need such as our law enforcement, road maintenance, and to make sure we keep our world class parks maintained and safe.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Kevin Flynn</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am running because I have the experience the position requires to provide leadership, perspective and institutional memory to a City Council that will have at least six new members. I was a reporter at the Rocky Mountain News from 1981 until the day it closed in 2009. I was the paper’s City Hall reporter and budget-finance expert for most of those years. Not only will I ask the tough questions; as a member of the Denver Press Club Hall of Fame, I have the demonstrated skills to ask the RIGHT questions. As a City Council member, I will continue District 2’s tradition of fiscal discipline and fierce independence. District 2 has the reputation of sending budget hawks to the council, and by background and experience, I will be that person on the next council. Retired City Council staff director John Bennett said of me: “Kevin knew more about the city government than the people who were running it.” That is why I have been endorsed by Doris Hackworth, wife of our late Councilman Ted Hackworth, retired Police Chief Ari Zavaras, retired Safety Manager John Simonet, as well as seven former City Council members including Cathy Reynolds, Ed Thomas and Cathy Donohue. I am the only candidate to spell out specific actions I intend to take to implement my platform of increased public safety, better economic growth and improved quality of life. They are spelled out on my website, <a href="http://www.flynnforcouncil.com/">FlynnForCouncil.com</a>.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">The most pressing issue is public safety. Auditor Dennis Gallagher released an audit last year of response times in all six police districts. The one covering southwest Denver had the longest average response times in the city, growing from 12 minutes in 2008 to 16 minutes in 2013. It is due mostly to the loss of 225 officers to retirement and other departures following the Great Recession, when the city couldn’t afford to pay for new police recruits. The geography of southwest Denver also delays response; there are so few through-routes that officers sometimes have to cut through the city of Littleton to get to the southern part of the district. The police commander has instituted some tactical changes that have started to bring that average down. But with city revenues growing again and police academy classes back on, the most effective solution is to assign more of the new officers to southwest Denver. I want to reduce the average response time by at least 25 percent, in line with the rest of the city. This is outlined on my website at <a href="http://www.flynnforcouncil.com/issues">FlynnForCouncil.com/issues</a>.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">We need improvement in quality-of-life services. Some of our long-time residents have told me they have seen a gradual decline in such things as street and park maintenance – cuts that were made in the recession, but which should be restored as basic city services. My wife and I knocked on the door of a woman who has lived next to Sanderson Gulch for 35 years, and who has been to Denver Health three times for severe allergic reactions to the invasive weeds growing in the gulch since the city stopped mowing the banks. Another 40-year resident of Mar Lee whom we met said she was told she should move to a better ZIP Code if she expected more. That is unacceptable. In southwest Denver, we don’t move to better ZIP Codes; we make our ZIP Codes better.</p>
                <p class="answer">The final issue is better economic growth in Council District 2. The economy is growing again and southwest Denver hasn’t fully taken advantage. There are several modest redevelopment opportunities in our commercial areas, especially at Sheridan and Evans, which has the potential to be a vibrant mixed-use district. It’s a very challenging task but it can be a great improvement to the district. It can be the seed bed for new locally owned small businesses and employment, an arts center or any number of pedestrian-oriented attractions.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">The 2000 Comprehensive Plan envisioned a city that values sustainability and livability for all of its residents. New development and density should be focused on areas where we are investing billions of dollars expanding rail mass transit and mobility options, and on the Areas of Change outlined in Blueprint Denver. There are great opportunities there to expand affordable housing, and to meet the demand for new housing that we are currently missing. I would focus on reinforcing the Areas of Stability outlined in the Blueprint through maintenance and improvement of city infrastructure, which encourages private investment by homeowners. I will ensure that neighborhood input is obtained early in the development process in order to identify contentious issues and work toward resolution. The city should work closely with RTD to identify more transit options to serve new development, and investigate opportunities for alternative mobility including expansion of car-sharing and Denver B-cycle to other areas of the city.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">The city already is taking steps that I believe are innovative and hold promise. It has identified several hundred chronic homeless and transient people on the streets of Denver who have been cycling in and out of various city services. This core population is responsible for more than $11 million per year in social service costs borne by the city. Getting most if not all of them into mental health, substance abuse or residential treatment programs may crack the core of the problem – a tipping point, hopefully, in easing the burden on the streets. This strategy is innovative and reflects my position that targeting the core will help ease the problem at the margins. I support the efforts of private, nonprofit and public entities that are working to ensure that when a homeless person sleeping in a park or in a business doorway is asked to “move along,” there is a place to which they can actually move other than the next park or doorway down the line, one that might offer diversion and treatment.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I differentiate between red light cameras and speeding cameras. Photo radar to enforce speed limits in residential areas, school zones and parks is effective and should continue. Red light cameras are not. I don’t want to photograph traffic accidents, I want to prevent them, and proper traffic engineering will do that. Traffic engineers know that red light running can be virtually eliminated through proper timing of the yellow light. Fort Collins added one second more yellow time at a camera intersection in 2005, and saw less than one driver per day running that red light. But until 2009, Denver used the legal minimum of just three seconds of yellow, which is too short for traffic moving faster than 30 mph. After I reported this in the Rocky Mountain News, Denver’s traffic engineers did a blind test. They took video at four busy intersections with three-second yellow lights and counted numerous red light violations. Then they added a half-second or so to the yellow light and took more video. The result was the near-elimination of red-light running. Based on that, Denver has lengthened yellow lights all around the city. If Denver identifies problem intersections and installs red light cameras instead of taking proven traffic engineering countermeasures, it is knowingly maintaining an unsafe condition.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I was the first candidate to come out in firm opposition to the raise. I issued a press release against it that was covered by the Denver Post and Westword. The previous salary was more than sufficient, in my opinion, and I personally lobbied several council members against it. But in the end, it passed and is the new salary level. I won’t work for less pay than my colleagues, so I will accept it – just as past and current council members who opposed pay raises accepted them if they passed. But what I will also do is take the lead on the council to identify a more politically palatable way to set council salaries every four years. Otherwise, I commit right now to voting “no” on the next raise discussion in four years.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">The emphasis on community policing has had success, and I have spoken with officers who believe they are getting better results. But there is much more to be done internally. There appears to be a disconnect between the chief and the rank-and-file that needs to be addressed. Chief White has been doing a great job in connecting with the community, and I would advise him to do more to connect with the officers.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">On the council, I will work with the mayoral administration to implement the recommendations in Auditor Dennis Gallagher’s recent report that detailed mismanagement, understaffing and delays in analyzing data that could more quickly resolve problems. The council will play a major role in fixing problems at the jail if it requires new operating expenditures to ensure adequate staffing levels are met, or capital expenditures to make physical changes that may be required to ensure the sheriff’s deputies can conduct their duties safely and responsibly. In addition, the council can and should have a consulting role with the administration in addressing management issues.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes. Voter approval is required in order to authorize a renewal of lodging and car rental taxes that are scheduled to expire, and I would favor that for two reasons. First, it does not change the tax rate, it simply extends the current rate. Second, the tax is paid for the most part by visitors and tourists who are choosing to come to Denver. And it would not be an increase for them either, since it is the existing rate. The comprehensive plan to revamp the National Western Center, reconnect neighborhoods, open up the South Platte River to the people and leverage RTD’s construction of a rail transit station there is important to the revitalization of Globeville, Swansea and Elyria.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">His greatest strength is his genuine care and concern for people. I was fortunate to witness this personally. Passionate concern for people as individuals is one of the most important traits for a public servant to possess. His greatest weakness is allowing his schedule to become so busy that he hasn’t had time to become familiar with some of the pressing issues in my southwest Denver district. I will ensure that he hears about our needs in District 2.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support the Career Service system because I believe it has worked well. Any change would have to be approved by voters, and several times in the past, voters have rejected charter proposals for collective bargaining that were referred to the ballot by the council. If workers pursue collective bargaining, I believe they should approach it through a ballot initiative.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">They are working for the most part, but one area that is costing us more than it should is in the area of licenses and inspections. I would propose that locations holding multiple licenses have the option of renewing all at the same time, so that required city inspections can be conducted during one visit rather than having inspectors visit the location multiple times.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No. Amendment 64 specifically prohibits public consumption. The state constitution would have to be amended again to allow it.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">No.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">With all of the attention that is drawn by large projects, I would like to see some additional priority on spending for small projects. For example, while campaigning I visited the home of an Iraq War veteran who uses an electric wheelchair to get around. But the house where his family raised him is on a street that has no sidewalk, curb, gutter or drainage. It has just a gravel shoulder – in the middle of the city. When there is snow or ice along the road, he can’t make it three blocks to the bus stop. This veteran shouldn’t have to move from his family’s home to be able to get around. Another example of needed small projects: Many District 2 residents have complained about speeding through the neighborhood. Periodic stepped-up enforcement can produce stop-gap improvements. But based on my transportation experience, I know that drivers naturally go faster when the road invites it. Wide streets produce higher speeds. Small projects such as bulb-outs, widened sidewalks or designated bike lanes that narrow the roadway can reduce speeds.</p>

                <h3 class="name">John E. Kidd Jr.</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I’m running for City Council because I believe the people in my district need a person with my skills and abilities to represent them and be their voice of reason on the council regarding issues important to them.  As a business professional with over 23 years’ experience in accounting, auditing, insurance, and information technology with several Fortune 500 companies, I have the necessary skills and experience needed to identify efficiencies and cost savings that can free up money for basic city services.  I currently serve my community as Treasurer and Board Member of two homeowner’s associations.  I work with fellow board members to keep our Southwest Denver community vibrant and most importantly, financially sound.  I recently earned the endorsement of District 2 Councilwoman Jeanne Faatz because of my civic and charitable service to the community and the commitment I’ve made to represent the citizens of Southwest Denver with honesty, transparency, and accountability.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Public Safety - As a council member, I would work with representatives of public safety to improve response times and to make sure the fine men and women who serve our community have the necessary resources they need to do their job safely and effectively.  According to City Auditor Dennis Gallagher’s report on response times, our district has one of the slowest response times (over 16 ½ minutes from 911 Dispatch to arriving on the scene) in Denver.  This is a matter of not having enough officers and resources to patrol all the areas of a very large, geographically challenging district. The extreme southern part of District 2 is situated between Jefferson and Arapaho counties, the cities of Lakewood, Littleton, and Denver along with some rather unique boundary lines which complicate the determination of jurisdiction at the time of the 911 call.  I would also support increased efforts to enlist the help of citizens in crime prevention through the Denver Police Department Volunteers In Police Service Program (VIPS) and promote neighborhood watch programs.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Affordable housing is a major issue for Downtown Denver and also in District 2.  We’ve seen unprecedented demand for housing over the past several years as Denver’s housing market has bounced back at a rather astonishing rate.  From the Denver Metro Association of Realtors March 2015 report, over the past year, we’ve seen single family housing prices increase by over 19% and condo prices by almost 7% as available inventory has dropped to record lows.  I’ll work with other members on the council to continue efforts to create more affordable housing options through existing programs available from the Denver Housing Authority and Federal Housing and Urban Development programs that provide block grants to assist residents of growing cities like Denver find affordable housing or assistance with housing expense.</p>
                <p class="answer">Code Enforcement – In order to keep our neighborhoods beautiful and vibrant, I’ll make sure the existing zoning codes are enforced and work to create a volunteer-based blight remediation program that assists those with special needs or circumstances that cannot maintain their property without help.  In my opinion, that’s what good neighbors do by helping each other out in times of need.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">People are moving to Denver in record numbers to enjoy the many great benefits our wonderful city has to offer.  With unemployment at a record low 4% and a strong demand for highly skilled, highly educated workers, Denver is attracting the best and brightest from all over the country and even the world.   The new developments that are in the process of being built right now are barely enough to keep up with the surge of people currently relocating to Denver.  That’s why it is very important for city government to manage growth in order to deal with uncontrolled urban sprawl, high density housing issues, and, of course, transportation and infrastructure overload. As detailed in the Blueprint Denver transportation and land use plan, the city must follow this comprehensive plan in order to grow the city in a “balanced”, responsible manner with a focus on livability and improving the quality of life for not just a select group of people, but for all the residents of Denver. We are seeing the fundamental change from traditional tract home neighborhoods like Stapleton, Globeville, Elyria, and Swansea in areas of growth to Transit Oriented Developments (TOD’s).  Our challenge as a city is to make sure we are doing this in a manner that doesn’t overburden the taxpayers, overextend the city’s credit, or simply get in the mode of trying to do too much too fast. Smart growth through proper planning is the way to go in my opinion.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">I applaud the efforts of the Denver Business Improvement District and the Downtown Denver Partnership in supporting the many faith-based initiatives that are working to make Downtown Denver safer and also efforts by individuals to guide those seeking assistance to the many available Downtown centers and resources for the homeless.   In my opinion, the City Council should continue to support efforts like the Lawrence Street Community Center and the St. Francis Center outreach to help those truly seeking assistance.  For those who have no desire for help, the Council needs to support the efforts of law enforcement to keep Downtown Denver safe for tourists and residents and support full enforcement of the unpopular camping ban.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do support the use of red-light cameras at intersections where drivers just blow right through the red light without any regard to safety.  Intersections where these cameras are installed should be clearly identifiable with signs that alert drivers that photo red-light cameras are in use and should have extended times for yellow lights and also some type of countdown mechanism to alert a drive as to how much time they have before the light turns red.  This would help prevent some of the rear-end collisions happening when drivers slam on the brakes in fear of getting a ticket.   My major concern with the red-light ticketing process is that tickets are being issued to drivers for just going past the white line.  I feel that during the review of white line violations, the technician should only ticket drivers who have driven past the white line into the cross walk only when pedestrians are present.</p>
                <p class="answer">I do support the use of photo radar on neighborhood side streets where children are present, construction zones, school zones, and areas where excessive speeding is an issue.  I would not support the expansion of red-light cameras and photo radar because I believe Denver currently has an appropriate amount of equipment in place to help reduce vehicle and pedestrian accidents at troublesome intersections from red light violations and slowing down driving speeds in high risk areas.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">On January 13th this year, of the over 50 municipal candidates for office at that time, I was the only candidate who attended the City Council Finance and Services Committee meeting and spoke out in opposition of the 10.3% raise.  I opposed this raise simply because the council had just received a 6 % raise over the past two years (3 % in 2013 and another 3% in 2014). I opposed the 10.3% raise because in my opinion, even though members of the council had full authority to approve the full salary increase, it just reinforced a perception by the public that government is not living within its means.  This was the council’s opportunity to show the voters they’re concerned with controlling the cost of city government.  I will not take this raise because I personally believe a 10% pay increase is out of line with salaries in other comparable municipalities and does not reflect typical private sector salary increases in Denver.  As I stated in my public testimony, once elected, I will not accept the salary increase and would give the difference to a charity or charities of my choosing within my district or simply return it to the General Fund.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support public safety and have the utmost respect for the men and women of Denver’s law enforcement.  I believe that some of the reforms Chief White has implemented are good, but some have had unintended consequences.  His requirement that officers wear body cameras is a step in the right direction along with enforcing disciplinary action for officer falsehoods.  His team concept provides better supervision but requires more officers than are currently available, and unfortunately, will not be available any time soon as we lose more officers to retirement and attrition.  His decision to flatten the organizational structure by eliminating the rank of captain sounded good initially but was more than offset by the addition of more commander positions.   Officer morale is at an all-time low after the Chief’s decision to allow the desecration of the fallen officer’s memorial.  I feel the Chief needs to make amends with not only the officers, but also with restoring confidence in the public that lawless acts will not be allowed to happen without intervention by law enforcement.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">The City Auditors Office headed by Auditor Dennis Gallagher just recently released on March 19th, 2015 a very alarming audit of the Denver Sheriff’s Department management of the Denver jail. From the audit, Auditor Gallagher stated “DSD’s management of jail operations has been poor, harming the City’s reputation, increasing risk to sheriff deputies and inmates, and wasting taxpayer resources.”  In my opinion, the Denver voters were sold a bad bill of goods when we were asked to approve the funding for the new jail.  The promise made to us was that the new jail would save the taxpayers money by streamline the incarceration process and reducing the number of personnel needed to operate the jail.  To date, there are major concerns with spending for overtime and severe issues with the safety of deputies and inmates that raise more questions than answers.  The jail has many blind spots that are extreme safety issues and need to be fixed now.  I understand that in May, hired consultants will present their initial recommendations in solving the jail crisis.  I feel the council should take steps now to address some of the audit recommendations to improve jail management and approve funding for additional personnel to alleviate understaffing.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes.  The National Western Center plan includes not just the stock show but many other attractions for year-round use.  Colorado State University and the Museum of Nature and Science are just two of the partners in this project.  I feel it is a perfect use of taxes paid primarily by tourists through lodging and car rental taxes.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">As Vice-President of Turnabout, Inc. a jobs program for non-violent first time offenders, I first met Mayor Michael Hancock when he was a city councilman at a church in South Denver where we both attended a community forum to address homelessness and ways to reduce recidivism at the Denver County Jail. The Mayor greatest strength is that he is a very likable person who is open to public input and makes himself extremely accessible to the people of Denver.  In my opinion, the Mayor’s greatest weakness is his inability to appoint top–level Public Safety Officials, specifically, the last two Denver Sheriffs as this department is in desperate need of a highly qualified, strong leader to get the department back on track.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do not believe that Denver’s civil service employees need to have collective bargaining rights simply because they have an excellent employment system in place.  The Office of Human Resources (formerly Career Services Authority) does an excellent job protecting civil service employees rights, providing exceptional compensation and benefits, and hiring and promoting employees based upon a competitive merit process.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do believe that Denver’s regulation on the sale of recreational marijuana for the most part is working.  The areas of concern that have been identified like unlicensed grow facilities and unlicensed sales are being ferreted out and shut down by the FBI, DEA, and local law enforcement through sting operations.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">Amendment 64 specifically prohibits the public consumption of marijuana.  I support the intended will of the voters who approved Amendment 64 and feel that public consumption of marijuana should not be allowed due to concerns with public safety, health and welfare.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, I believe there should be a tobacco ban on the 16th Street Mall mainly because this is a pedestrian mall used by many families with small children and those with respiratory issues who are adversely affected by second hand smoke.  Additionally, I would support a smoking ban on the Mall due to the many restaurants with open air seating for patrons who are also affected by second-hand smoke from smokers at tables next to them or from smokers walking along the mall.</p>
                <p class="answer">In regards to city parks, I don’t believe it’s necessary to impose a smoking ban simply because of the inherent openness of the park.   Unlike city streets where there is no option to avoid a person who is smoking in front of you as you are walking or smoking as you walk by them, at least in a  park you have the option to go to an area where there are no smokers if you prefer.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe there should be more emphasis on fully funding basic city services first and foremost.  The diversion of monies from the general fund to special projects or other purposes has to stop.  Additionally, street maintenance, additional lane miles paved, and increased public safety funding for more police officers were promises made to the voters with the passage of Measure 2A in 2012.  Unfortunately, Denver’s streets are in need of serious repair and repaving and the Denver Police Department is still dealing with not having enough new officers graduating from the Police Academy to replace those officers retiring or from attrition.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Danny F. Lopez</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I first ran for this City Council Seat in 2003 because I truly wanted to be a representative of the people and I was fed up with City Council Members complaining about their pay. That year I ran on a platform to raise the minimum wage. Citizens of Denver still do not earn a livable wage. In 2007 I got on the ballot to challenge Mayor Hickenlooper, who would have run unopposed. I wanted to make sure the Voters of Denver had an alternative choice. That election I received 10,000 alternative votes. In 2011 I ran for Mayor of Denver, in a very crowded field, I felt I owed it to the voters who voted for in 2007 to get on the ballot again. I was known as the Working Man's Representative. Running for Public Office shouldn't go to the highest bidder, the high paid executive, the entrenched governing professional official. Voters want and need a different type of candidate they can identify with, a candidate they can like. They want a candidate that will return Local Government back to the Citizens of Denver, a candidate that will SHAKE THINGS UP</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Trying to restore faith in City Government. Many citizens in Denver hate City Government they don't even vote. They are mad at Elected Officials, they are upset with Public Works, they complain about 311, They want City Government given back to the Citizens  </p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Too many parking tickets being written just to generate money for the City and upset the property owners and restoring the faith in City Government</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Research, Community input, I think you should have had some more personal questions so the voters can see and learn more about all the candidates. In every election they all make the same promises of what they are going to do (economic growth, community improvement, safety and all the other catchy promises) They get elected and nothing changes. We are all tired of the same promises and same candidates. Time to elect an alternative choice    </p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">To make sure funding for the program to end homelessness does not come out of the general fund  </p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">NO!! I am against the use of red light cameras to generate funds for the  City. What a big money grab </p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">No of course not this is the 4th  campaign I have run in. in each one I refused to take the pay raises they were getting and it seems like were always talking about pay raises for elected officials enough is enough already. Look it up I have always refused to take the raises. Matter of fact I was one of 3 people to testify against the pay raises the Mayor Cabinet received at the General Finance Committee Meeting </p>    
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">No Police moral is at a all time low the rank and file do not agree with what is taking place in the DPD When I ran for Mayor in 2011 I wanted the new chief to come from with in the department It is right to promote from with in the rank and file. </p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">Some one tell me which City Councilperson got truly upset or in any one's face about what has transpired at the County Jail No Bite in their Bark some one needs to SHAKE THINGS UP  </p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">No the free market should dictate how that program should be funded </p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">His Charismatic personality. I still haven't figured out his greatest weakness, When we ran for office in 2011 we sat next to each other a few times and I found him to be a lot of fun to be around. When he asked for my endorsement I should of asked him if I could run Public Works </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">What people fail to realize that the 40 hour work week, overtime, benefits, safety, and holidays we have, are the direct result of what Unions fought for in the 1930's and 1940's. The only way to protect worker rights, wages and benefits is thru a strong collective bargaining agreement so that City Council can not take away wages and benefits from the City Workers   I believe in a livable wage for all workers in Denver and in the benefits of collective bargaining    </p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">No I believe smokers have Rights too</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would make sure we spend our budget in the City and County of Denver. In 2011 when I ran for Mayor we talked about things being purchased from out of city and state. Nothing has changed we still buy a lot of goods from other cities and states instead of local vendors  </p>

                <h3 class="name">Jeanne Labuda</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am running for City Council because I want to maintain Jeanne Faatz’s commitment to the citizens of District 2 by bringing my financial and budgetary expertise to the Denver City Council.  While serving as a State Representative, I sat on the Finance Committee for 8 years and on the Appropriations Committee for 2 years; because of this experience, I am well versed in budgetary matters, and will keep a close watch on Denver’s budget.</p>
                <p class="answer">As a city councilwoman, I will work with the City as well as the Public Works Department to keep our streets and sidewalks in good repair.  I will continue my support for small businesses, as I did in the State House, to keep our economy going strong.  I will work closely with Denver Public Schools and with Denver Parks and Recreation to ensure that all students have daily physical education time; we need to give them exercise and healthy food for the body as well as for the mind to live long and productive lives.  We also need to get the arts and music back in all schools, because art and music help students excel in math and science.   I will work to get better services for our mentally ill citizens.  I will work closely with our police department to ensure that our neighborhoods stay safe.</p>
                <p class="answer">I will work with all these groups, and more.  I plan to have weekly meetings in my office for interest groups and interested citizens, so that we can talk, get facts, propose new ideas, compromise when necessary, and make changes that are needed.</p>
                <p class="answer">I have a history of working to solve southwest Denver’s problems, and I will continue doing so.  </p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">From what I have heard from constituents, one of the biggest concerns in our community is how to continue developing our businesses and communities.  I have already started investigating opportunities in this area, and it is clear that creative solutions will have to be found, since most of the places the residents would like to see improved are privately owned.  The location of the WalMart store across from the King Soopers store (at the northern intersection of U.S. 285 and South Sheridan Boulevard) is owned by the Duke Family, and they have sole control over what business(es) they lease to.  At the location of the Dollar Store on South Sheridan Boulevard near Evans Avenue, ownership is spread among about 20 owners, from what I understand, and these 20 owners formed a consortium to buy the property from Target, the former owner.  Jeanne Faatz, our current city councilwoman, has worked with both these groups, with no success.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">I am very interested as a city council member in finding creative ways to combat childhood obesity in our community with outdoor and in school programs. With fully a third of Americans now classified as obese, I want to use the natural beauty and advantages of Colorado to improve the health of our young people.   I will work with the Denver Public Schools and with the Department of Parks and Recreation to get more physical education in schools.</p>
                <p class="answer">Another constant issue for our city that I will do my very best to address is the many problems with our roads. I recognize that the seasonal conditions in Colorado are not healthy for our roads.  However, there are some neighborhood streets that are in terrible shape and have been neglected for years; they need repaving, and I will make sure that happens if I am elected.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that, like many other large cities, we will continue building tall buildings rather than building out. I think this concept of development is important for preserving the natural scenery of Colorado.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">I feel that focusing on building our support services can be a better long term solution for homelessness in Denver than focusing on enforcement. Helping the homeless find stability, work, and a place to live is more permanent than trying to kick them off of 16th Street Mall each week.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I don’t know how effective this program is.  Twice I have received notices that I was speeding; both times, when I called the number given and told them I never was in that area and gave them my car type and color and my license plate number, the speeding notices were eliminated.  Based on my experience, the program is not working well, but I don’t want to eliminate it until we have a sufficient number of police hired.  We don’t have enough police personnel to do the job.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I will accept the raise, but I will look for programs in my District that need more funds to operate and support them.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">I have seen evidence in my community that Chief White’s modernization of our police force has been a good step forward for our law enforcement community. Our police are working smarter than ever with other police departments to make the very most of the limited resources their department has. The biggest need that Chief White has is for more personnel, and the current City Council has been working on that, and I will continue to advocate for more police personnel.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">An outside review of this issue is being conducted.  Manager of Safety Stephanie O’Malley has said that as soon as it comes, she will read it and take appropriate action.  I, too, will wait until the outside review is completed, and then work to get changes made.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes. I feel that as much as possible the bulk of our expenses for tourist events should first and foremost fall on the tourists themselves, which seems easy enough to achieve through rental rates for vehicles and space.  The current plan is simply to extend the tax we currently have on lodging and car rentals, with no increase in the amount.  I support this approach.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">I see Mayor Hancock’s greatest strength to be his leadership.  At the same time, I believe that his greatest weakness is not consulting residents when a change is coming to their neighborhood; I am thinking of a neighborhood in Southeast Denver that lost a designated park without being consulted; we have too many “done deals".</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do support collective bargaining rights for city employees.  I feel that having a voice for themselves makes workers more motivated and feel more secure when they go to work each day.  There will, of course, have to be some limits to ensure the health and safety of our citizens in case of a strike.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think the regulations are working.  I will continue to monitor very closely the retail sales and growth of marijuana if I am elected.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No. Marijuana consumption should remain a private matter on private property.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Possibly.  Since the 16th Street Mall is a primary destination of visitors to Denver, I would be willing to listen to the opinions of the Denver Visitors Bureau and other parties carefully on such a decision. I do not feel that it is necessary to ban smoking in all of our city parks, although I would like to see more cigarette butts disposed of in trash cans rather than on our sidewalks.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would go over the existing budget with representatives from the city agencies served by that budget before making any changes. However, I will work to dedicate city funds to ensure that more of our emergency responders are staffed with emergency medical services to ensure the safety of our people.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Paul Lopez</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am running for reelection to continue my oath and commitment to representing the hard working people of West Denver on the Denver City Council.  For far too long, our district was disregarded, resulting in a lack of public and private investment, and stifling opportunity and growth in our communities. Over the past 8 years,I’m proud to say this has changed.  We have improved access to city services, created new park space, and replaced liquor stores with grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants and libraries. We have prioritized paving streets and alleys, and invested in replacing bridges while creating local job and business opportunities. Finally,we established common sense zoning and collaborated with investors to create 454 new units of quality, affordable housing. Alot has been achieved, but we still have a lot of work to do. I am running for my final term on the Denver City Council, because no matter where we choose to live in Denver, a zip code should not be the only determinant of our future. </p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">The biggest challenge we face in our district is working to reverse decades-long lack investment in our infrastructure, access to city services, park space and other common community amenities as well as access to community serving businesses like grocery stores. In eight years of being in office, I have worked with many community leaders organizations to rebuild our community and rekindle community participation.  So far, we have:</p>
                <p class="answer">1) Revitalized and built healthier West Denver neighborhoods by creating laws to keep marijuana shops 1,000 ft. from schools and rehab centers. We organized against nine new liquor store applications and instead, replaced them with grocery stores, restaurants and libraries. Finally, we built the first new park in West Denver in nearly 30 years with 54 more park acres coming in 2015.</p>
                <p class="answer">2) Improved city services.  We have worked side-by-side with city workers to improve city services like reducing illegal dumping and neighborhood litter by replacing city dumpsters with roll-off barrels and increasing District 3 recycling participation from 12 percent to 40 percent. I have worked with the street maintenance to identify and repave our neighborhood streets and paved West Denver’s infamous dirt alleys.</p>
                <p class="answer">3) Continued to fight for affordable housing and create jobs for West Denver by collaborating with non-profit, public, and private sector partners to create approx 454 units of affordable housing and hundreds of jobs for our neighborhoods to combat unemployment and foreclosures. Recently, I worked with CDOT to replace six outdated bridges along 6th Avenue, creating hundreds of good paying jobs for local residents. Currently, I am creating a law to give Denver Metro Area companies preference over out-of-state companies for all City contracts with requirements to hire locally.</p>
                <p class="answer">4) Finally, in addition to advocating for better police response times,  I am continuing to prioritize neighborhood safety and crime prevention by collaborating with law enforcement and community leadership to improve community trust and participation in reporting crime.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">1.) Access to affordable housing in Denver is a challenge in our city.  Development and reinvestment in our community is welcome, however, but we need to make sure that long time residents can continue to live in the City without having to sell their home to do so.</p>
                <p class="answer">2.) We need to make sure that we are maximizing community benefits in all city contracting. This also means that we give local preference to Denver Metro Area businesses that prioritize the creation of quality jobs for Denver residents.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Where parking is scarce, new development must account for its impact on local parking, and should provide adequate spaces for its tenants and patrons. Single family and duplex homes should also provide for adequate off street parking depending on the scarcity of parking spots in the immediate neighborhood.    We also need to prioritize the build-out of pedestrian and bicycle-friendly infrastructure to allow people to move around town without the need for a vehicle. Finally, we have to allow for small neighborhood serving businesses in Denver. Giving our residents viable shopping options just steps from where they live. </p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">Being homeless is a tragedy, not a crime. Therefore, I do not believe restrictions on the homeless like the Denver urban camping ban (which I voted against) are a humane or effective way to help reduce homelessness. Homelessness is a complex issue and requires more effort and resources from the public sector to fully empower current programs and outreach.  I believe that the city should:</p>
                <p class="answer">1) Have a more robust outreach effort to homeless individuals by adding more outreach workers to serve as resources to folks in need;</p>
                <p class="answer">2) Continue to build temporary and permanent housing, as well as shelters with on-site wrap around services for the homeless. If we can be in the business of using tax dollars to build hotels, we can do the same for shelters; and</p>
                <p class="answer">3) Truly address the issues that lead to homelessness. Homelessness is the result of, and is indicative a failure to fully invest in policies and initiatives to fight poverty.  In order to prevent homelessness, we must tackle the issues that lead to it.  By enacting progressive policies that ensure a living wage, access to affordable healthcare and mental health services, enacting progressive policies to create affordable housing and encourage local hiring, we then will begin to make progress in addressing systematic poverty before it puts more people and families onto the street.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, I support the city’s use, and expansion of photo radar and red light camera enforcement.</p>
                <p class="answer">First, accidents have been reduced dramatically at intersections where there is red light camera enforcement. That means motorist awareness of these dangerous intersections has increased and lives have been saved. There is nothing worse than getting a phone call that a love one is in the hospital because of an accident. Finally, intersections need to be clear and safe passages for pedestrians, especially for disabled or mobility-impaired persons.  Far too often vehicles stop in the crosswalk, blocking folks who cannot simply walk around vehicles without walking into moving traffic.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">Actual salary increase over the four-year period mandated by charter is 2.575 percent per year, which is lower than the average salary increase for Denver City Employees.  To answer the question, I do plan to accept the increase because it is not a random and unscientific increase. It based off the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) as mandated by Denver City Charter. These are the methods for determining salaries as decided by Denver voters. By not honoring the CPI and COLA, we undermine it as credible basis and method for determining salaries for all workplaces.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support the changes that Chief White has implemented, to improve efficiency by flattening the department and placing more officers on patrol.  I also commend Chief Robert White for his leadership in helping improve community policing and working to improve community trust in law enforcement.  However, I also I believe there is more than can be done.  The department must do a better job to promote and hire police that reflect the community in which they work. There is something to be said about the interaction between a community and an officer who is working to improve and patrols the neighborhood in which they grew up/live.   Finally, I would look to improvecommunity policing by having officers patrol out of their vehicle a few times and walking or biking the beat. This allows for more interaction and establishes trust. </p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">As the legislative branch of the City that represents Denver’s 11 council districts and votes on the annual budget, the Denver City Council’s role is critical. This is why as Chairman of the Council’s Safety and Well-Being Committee, I fought to represent the Denver City Council on the Denver Sheriff Reform Task Force. Once the full independent review and recommendations are public, I plan asking for a full presentation and briefing in my committee to discuss and analyze the report in detail.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do support the plan. I believe that this will have a an immense return on investment for the city and at the same time replace outdated and blighted  venues that can serve to host many more cultural, sports and entertainment based events for the People of Denver. Equally important is the economic and community development opportunity this will create for the city, and especially for the surrounding neighborhoods of Globeville, Elyria, and Swansea.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Like me, he is a Denver native who struggled though poverty to get where he is -- I respect that.   Mayor Hancock is a good man, and his greatest strength is his willingness to support efforts to restore much needed focus to improve historicallyunderserved areas of Denver while creating new initiatives to expand economic opportunity for all Denver residents and businesses. As a Councilman, I am pleased to have his support on our many efforts in West Denver.  As far as weaknesses, well, have you heard his wife sing?! He loses all focus, and it is hard to snap him out of his love stupor. The same can also be said when he is dining at Tom’s in Five Points.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Whether it is working on the back of a trash truck or in an office cubicle, Denver’s civil service employees are civil servants in their own right and work for the benefit of the people of Denver. It is without question for me that Denver civil service employees not be treated any differently fromother public or private employees in having the right to organize without retaliation and to collectively bargain for fair pay and safe working conditions, health care, a secure retirement and a voice in their workplace.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">Overall, Denver has been successful in regulating an entirely new and unprecedented industry. However, there are still issues that we must address, such as the overconcentration of dispensaries in lower-income neighborhoods and the limiting of opportunity for other important community-serving businesses.  For this reason,  I authored amendments to the regulatory ordinance that were adopted ensuring that dispensaries remained 1,000 ft. from schools, rehab centers, and other dispensaries; and that  beginning in 2016, the application process for a new dispensary will be determined by the needs and desires of the surrounding neighborhood via a mandatory public hearing. </p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No. We should not allow public consumption of marijuana.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, I do support the proposed ordinance for the smoking ban. However, we need to be mindful that we are not intentionally pushing smokers on to the properties of businesses along the mall and creating an unhealthy environment for those who patronize and work at these businesses.  We should work with these businesses to encourage and adopt no-smoking signage and policies areas on their properties in tandem with the rollout of the proposed changes. I also support banning tobacco usage in Denver Parks as well.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">For decades, neighborhoods in Council District 3, along with other poorer, minority-populated areas of the city have been disregarded as a priority, resulting in a decrease in neighborhood health and quality of life. As a city, we cannot allow this to happen. Regardless of the council district or zip code, taxpaying Denver residents should not have to constantly battle unnecessary bureaucracy for basic city services and investment.  Therefore, it is important that we prioritize the budget in an equitable manner to make sure neighborhoods are not left behind. Whether it involves street paving, parkbeautification, community planning efforts, or police response,we must invest in areas based on greatest need and impact, notjust where it is easy, affluent, or politically expedient.</p>

                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am passionate about my southeast Denver community and about our city as a whole. I am running for office to be part of the decision-making that keeps us on course to become a world-class city.  As a Denver native, I have witnessed firsthand Denver’s incredible transformation from a medium-sized city to one that’s the envy of the nation. Our economy is strong, our unemployment is low, our neighborhoods are friendly; it’s no wonder people are moving here at the fastest rate we’ve seen in years.  As Denver continues to grow, our city leaders must address the challenges associated with that growth:  housing, homelessness, burdens on infrastructure, public safety, education, workforce training, traffic and transportation, and other downsides of accommodating more people, buildings and infrastructure.  We must also work to keep our economy strong, cooperate with our regional neighbors, and preserve our neighborhood character. I am running for Denver, the city I love, and to fight for southeast Denver ensuring that all citizens have a voice in the decisions made about our district.</p>

                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Southeast Denver needs a vision and a comprehensive plan to guide future development and bring the District into the 21st century in terms of walkability, transportation options, retail and restaurants, and housing options.  Today, our commercial streets in southeast Denver are not bike-able, walkable or safe to cross. As a result, our four light rail stations are accessible to many of us only by car.  Much of the commercial development on our busy streets—whether built in the 1970s or the 2000s—lacks cohesiveness or aesthetic appeal.  With a vision and a plan, we can create a community oriented, pedestrian and bike-friendly “main street,” and provide greater opportunities for new retail, restaurants and mixed-use development.</p>
                <p class="answer">I will convene a task force comprised of District 4 residents, city planners, property owners, business owners and developers to begin creating a vision for southeast Denver and ultimately a small area or neighborhood plan to guide future growth.  Denver’s land use and transportation plan, Blueprint Denver, encourages communities to create these plans to address neighborhood issues within citywide goals.  I have already talked with people at the office of Community Planning and Development about initiating this process in southeast Denver.</p>
                <p class="answer">After personally knocking on more than 7,000 doors, the main topics that have come up in conversations with voters are:  traffic and infrastructure, photo radar and red light cameras, concerns about density and growth, and issues with the police and sheriff.</p>

                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">1.    I will work to develop new transportation options in the district.  With four light rail stations—and one on our southern border—most southeast Denver residents don’t use light rail.  There are many obstacles to accessing light rail, including the fact that our commercial streets are not safe to cross which limits walking to the stations.  Additionally, there is not adequate parking at our light rail stations, particularly at the Yale and the Colorado stations.  Years ago, the B-Line shuttled us down Colorado Boulevard.  I’m interested in reviving something like the B-line and working with transportation experts on innovating new strategies to make it easier for us to use public transportation.</p>
                <p class="answer">2.  District 4 is home to one of the largest senior populations in the City.  Our seniors and their needs are incredibly diverse.  For those active retired people who would like to be more engaged in the community, I will work to help them to be a resource to others, perhaps helping other seniors or volunteering at a school.For those seniors who need some type of assistance to maintain the quality of life they want, I will dedicate staff time to help connect them to the resources they need.  There are countless resources available for seniors.  From personal experience and from talking with voters, I’ve learned that those resources are not always easy to find.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Traffic and infrastructure improvements are among the top concerns of people I have talked with in District 4.  Unfortunately, as our city grows, increased automobile traffic and burdens on our roads is likely to get worse.  And, despite the number of mass transit options we provide, newcomers to Denver are bringing their cars with them.  If elected, I will work to make alternatives to driving easier for all of us. I support collaboration with the city, transportation experts like Transportation Solutions, RTD, and the private sector to develop creative, appealing and effective new ways to get people out of their cars.  I was disappointed in RTD’s rejection of partnering with Bridj – an innovative mass transit system. We need to find convenient transportation alternatives to get us to and from the light rail.</p>
                <p class="answer">Realistically though, because most of us still do drive, I support maintaining parking requirements.  District 4 residents can drive to Park Meadows or Cherry Creek Mall in about the same amount of time.  Because Cherry Creek is a great source of Denver’s sales tax revenue, it is essential that parking be readily available in Cherry Creek and other shopping areas so that we don’t choose to shop in another city.</p>
                <p class="answer">As Denver changes, developments at transit-oriented developments and the development of communities where people can live and work should continue to be a top priority.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">Homeless is a heartbreaking and confounding issue facing our city. City leaders—public, private and non-profit—have to balance personal civil rights, property rights, humanitarian responsibilities and the greater good for our city.  There is no perfect solution, but I am hopeful that we can make progress.</p>
                <p class="answer">I applaud Mayor Hancock’s creation of the Office of Behavioral Strategies and his choice of Don Mares as executive director.  Mares’ experience in government and as the head of Mental Health America Colorado and the Department of Labor uniquely qualifies him to look at longer term solutions for homelessness.</p>
                <p class="answer">I agree with the city’s efforts to expand services and housing through partnerships and to pass certain restrictions.  The two efforts can actually be complimentary.  By enforcing bans, police can help homeless people get housing and the services they need.  I don’t believe the intent of the bans is to make arrests. I support the concept of a Solutions Center, more housing and wrap-around services, and the use of Social Impact Bonds to create new solutions.  Additionally, Denver should collaborate with our neighboring cities on solutions and the creation of more housing options.</p>
                <p class="answer">Our homeless population is a diverse group and includes families, mentally ill people, runaways and more.  There is no single fix.  As a city, region and society we need to persist in our efforts to help those in need.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">Unless there is strong evidence showing that their use makes our streets safer, I oppose both red light camera and photo radar.  Many voters with whom I have spoken are adamantly opposed to this type of enforcement, and feel that the cameras’ use is only to generate revenue and not to promote safety. Such a perception creates ill will toward the Denver Police Department and the city.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">As soon as the Denver Post reported the new Denver City Council salaries, I released a statement opposing the raises. If I am fortunate to serve, I will either return the salary increase amount to the city’s general fund or I will donate it to southeast Denver schools.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Chief White’s reform efforts to assign more officers to the street is positive.  It’s unclear, however, why response times have gone up instead of down.  In District 4, I have heard from residents who think that response times are too long.  Another of Chief White’s reforms is the use of body cameras. The Department is about six months into a pilot program, and the results are positive.  I support body cameras and believe they will be used effectively over time and improve Denver’s policing.</p>
                <p class="answer">Crime is down in Denver overall, but not in all communities.  The relationship between the police and some communities needs to strengthen.  I am encouraged by the DPD’s efforts to engage:  Chief White has increased his community outreach efforts, attending meetings and encouraging community members to help identify and eliminate bad policing.  Denver Police Department Commander Joe Montoya holds a monthly community meeting at the District 3 station on the first Thursday of each month.  He regularly encourages the public to reach out, ask questions and report suspicious activity.  I support continued community engagement across the city. </p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Council should ask tough questions of the Mayor and the Manager of Safety about how and why the Sheriff’s department was allowed to run so poorly for so long.  The Council should understand the origins of some of the issues like the flawed design of the jail and inadequate staffing.  The Council should also have complete understanding of the reform process and proposed solutions.  With an independent monitor, multiple consultants and investigators, and a panel overseeing the reform effort, the city can solve this.  </p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes. Extending the lodging and car rental tax will fund this great addition to our city without further burdening Denver taxpayers.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Hancock genuinely loves Denver.  His optimism, enthusiasm and genuine passion for making Denver a better place are contagious.  He attracts great people to his team who want to work toward the same goals. However, I am disappointed with the amount of time it took to address the many issues of abuse and mismanagement within the Sheriff’s Department.  I would like to see a greater commitment on his part to intergovernmental relations and regional cooperation as well.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">My impression is that the current career service system provides fair and sufficient protection for city employees. I would be reluctant to revisit the issue again on the ballot, as Denver voters twice in the recent past have turned down proposed measures to grant bargaining rights to city employees.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">On the whole, Denver is responding well to the challenges of implementing Amendment 64 and the previously passed medical marijuana law. City Council – led by Councilman Charlie Brown – put a great deal of effort into creating the Denver ordinance, including hours of citizen and industry input. I am comfortable with the current regulatory regime in place, but know that this is an evolving matter requiring constant monitoring and reevaluation.  Amendments and new regulations will have to address new issues that arise related to public safety, revenue collection, zoning and licensing.</p>
                <p class="answer">The city does need to close all of the regulatory loopholes and oversee collectives, hash oil extraction and caregivers.  All growers, except for personal users, should be licensed. The city needs to continue to fight the illegal drug trade and continue educating the public about marijuana laws.</p>
                <p class="answer">I am very concerned about THC-treated edibles and that these products may be accessible to children. The state is now requiring child-resistant packaging and product marking, and regulating potency. The city and state have a willing partner in the legal marijuana industry that is law-abiding, but we need to continue to address this.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am completely opposed to permitting the public consumption of marijuana.  Marijuana has a strong and distinctive odor that is offensive to many people – especially those who visit Denver for reasons other than to buy retail marijuana.  Just as we do with our open container law with respect to alcohol, I would encourage police to more strongly enforce the law banning public consumption of marijuana.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am in favor of a pilot program to determine if a smoking ban would achieve the intended consequences.  Some of the unintended consequences might include pushing smokers off of the 16th Street Mall and onto side streets.  Hoteliers are concerned that smokers will begin to loiter in front of their hotels, which only serves to shift the problem elsewhere.  Multiple factors should be considered before making this decision.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">Before deciding new spending priorities, it’s necessary to look at the $1.7 billion city budget as a whole. Once I’m elected, one of my first priorities will be to become educated about our revenue sources and spending priorities over time.</p>
                <p class="answer">When considering new spending priorities for the city, we should ask ourselves where we are spending too much before deciding where we spend too little – just as we would approach a private sector or family budget.  And before shifting spending, we have to ask ourselves hard questions such as, “Is this decision guided by politics or necessity?” “Is there a more efficient way to spend our money to arrive at the same goals?” “What are the downstream effects of these new spending priorities?”</p>
                <p class="answer">That said, in District 4, I would like to see more resources directed to walkability and to a community planning process.  Second, judging from the deterioration of many of our southeast Denver roads  – thoroughfares and neighborhood streets alike – we could use significant pavement improvements. Lastly, the perception with many voters I’ve spoken with is that police response times have slowed despite the new additions of personnel.  I would also like to see a further increase in neighborhood patrols to ensure faster response times. </p>

                <h3 class="name">Halisi Vinson</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am running because Southeast Denver has a deep-seated need for servant leadership.  The residents of District 4 often feel forgotten, and voiceless.  This is an exciting time for Denver and for Southeast Denver as we prepare to welcome 100 thousand more residents to our city.</p>
                <p class="answer">It will be important that we have leadership that can think strategically and has the ability to go beyond statutory responsibilities to solve the issues of the day.  I have engaged my neighbors in brainstorming solutions to enhance our local economy, to maintain and create affordable housing, and to create a more walkable District 4.</p>
                <p class="answer">Denver needs leadership on City Council that understands the challenges that neighborhood businesses face.  Southeast Denver needs a voice that understands the correlation between strong local economies and neighborhoods where residents thrive. </p>

                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">One of the biggest challenges facing my district is making sure that while we engage in much needed redevelopment that we do not loose the mid-century character of Southeast Denver.  We must be vigilant to not overdevelop as we create an environment that is easily accessible whether you’re 8 years old or 80.</p>

                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">1.  Empty Retail spaces compromise the viability of our District 4 community and the surrounding retail spaces and can pose safety issues.  District 4 has many empty retail spaces that can provide an extraordinary opportunity to provide new ways to create community space, entrepreneurial space, collaborative workspace, and other ideas. We could create partnerships with organizations like:</p>
                <p class="answer">Newsed Community Development Organization, Denver Retail Incubator, Landlords, Community Groups & Cultural Organizations and Neighborhood Business Leaders</p>
                <p class="answer">2. District 4 needs to become the national model for what a “retrofitted suburbia” looks like. There are a lot of things that can be done to invest in the physical environment. Here’s some ways we might build walkable communities:</p>
                <p class="answer">* Bring businesses closer to the sidewalk (hide the parking in back)<br>
                * Collaborate with Community Planning and Development, and Public Works<br>
                * Potential Partnership with programs like Safe Routes to School<br>
                * Potential Partnership with programs like B-Cycles in SE Denver<br>
                * Mixed income, mixed use zoning<br>
                * Neighborhood Slow Zones for pedestrian safety<br>
                * Repurpose parking lots</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am working with my RTD Board Representative, Dr. Claudia Folska to deal with the last mile issue.  While knocking on doors I have learned that we have residents in our community that would like to take public transportation more often, but cost, and irregular schedules, especially later at night, make public transportation prohibitive.  For the suburbs, density is going to be a challenge, as long as our transit system is geared towards supporting downtown commuting.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">One of our biggest challenges in the coming decade will be solving the issues of homelessness.  It is a moral imperative.  Moreover, while knocking on doors my some neighbors have felt less safe as the amount of panhandlers increase not only downtown but also on our suburban streets.  Studies show that cities spend anywhere from $17k to $40k annually on jailing, emergency medical services, and other city services for the population that is homeless.  According to Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, we can spend up to $40k a year and yet their Denver Housing First Collaborative spends about $11k annually for housing plus support services.</p>
                <p class="answer">Salt Lake City they have taken a more creative and pragmatic approach, similar to what the Coalition suggests and I believe it is worth investigating as a possiblity here in Denver.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">There’s been a quite of bit of controversy surrounding the use and placement of red-light cameras and photo-speeding vans.  My opinion on the use of these tools has evolved as I started investigating ways to make my district more pedestrian friendly.  I took a blindfolded walk with my RTD Director, Dr. Claudia Folska, a person who has lost her sight.  The goal was to learn how easy it is to walk from one of our transit-oriented developments to the nearest light rail station.  In order to get to the light rail, we have to cross Hampden Avenue, an eight-lane highway.</p>
                <p class="answer">A few things became apparent quickly; if cars edge out over the crosswalk it becomes very dangerous for pedestrians. I’ve noticed that drivers pay close attention to other vehicles but seem not to notice pedestrians and cyclists.  Whatever we can do to help ensure the safety of pedestrians, as we strive towards a more multi-modal city, is always welcome.</p>

                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would return the raise.  For at least three years, city employees were asked to take furlough days that in some cases equaled a ten percent cut in.  I cannot, in good conscious, accept a raise while city employees have not been made whole.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">In order to lessen the impact of the hiring moratorium, Chief White replaced police officers at the dispatch office with civilians.  During my ride-a-long with the District 3 police, they voiced concerned that some calls that would probably have been transferred to the fire department or de-escalated over the phone were put on the response list; increasing the response times for all calls.</p>
                <p class="answer">There is still in opportunity for training to make sure our police are de-escalating situations as quickly as possible and to help build and rebuild trust in the community.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">I have had conversations with District Attorney Mitch Morrissey about this problem and I’ve attended the mayor’s community brainstorming sessions.  We can all agree that lawsuits and settlements that have cost Denver taxpayers approximately $11million are unacceptable.   Our Sheriffs are jailers but they do not have the same training as those managing our prisons; this is missed opportunity that needs to be rectified.</p>
                <p class="answer">Partnering with the Manager of Safety and other stakeholders to implement training and find additional solutions that not only eliminates lawsuits, but ensures accountability and rebuilds community trust should be a priority. </p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Visit Denver seems to be okay with extending lodging and car rental taxes and it is definitely wise to invest in one of our city’s treasures without compromising other city services.  My concern is that there is a direct correlation between the national economy and tourism.  I would hate for this project to be slowed because of another recession.  It would be prudent to devise a contingency plan.</p>

                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">One Mayor Hancock’s greatest strength is his likability and his agenda of inclusivity.  While knocking on doors I’ve heard from some of my neighbors that they would like to see him in the district even more.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Forming a union takes time; while the process is being investigated, we need to look at what conditions currently exist that are unreasonable and/or unfair.  For example, if it is pay, then we need to find the pay statistics for similar cities and adjust our rates accordingly.  These issues should be addressed while creating an atmosphere where workers have the ability to work on collective bargaining.</p>

                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">Now that we have increased regulation around edibles and child resistant packaging, we should see some improvement in outcomes.  I had a conversation with one of the inspectors from the fire department and we might need to increase our investment in inspectors.  The type of pesticides used is a concern and some growers are still not meeting standards.  According to the inspector that I spoke with, there is still uncertainty about how these pesticides will react when heated up; and uncertainty about how much is getting into edibles.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">We do not allow the public to carry open containers of alcohol and we should not allow the public to consume marijuana in public.</p>
                <p class="answer">We still will have to address the issue of visitors who wish to consume marijuana and are not staying in a private home.  Just as hoteliers have banned cigarette smoking they should have a right to ban marijuana smoking. Consequently we will need to come up with a solution in order to avoid taxing our police department with enforcement call.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Personally, I would love a smoking band; however the cost of enforcement would be prohibitive and not a good use of an already stretched-thin police force.</p>

                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">One of the priorities for District 4 needs to be investment in infrastructure and road maintenance.  We have put policies in place that encourage a more multi-modal city; however we do not have the infrastructure to support the efforts.  Investments in protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and ADA compliant intersections would go a long way in helping my district.</p>

                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">Although my first career was in Higher Education, my avocation has been civic engagement, as described in the "Experience” column.  I knew that when I could I wanted to do city stewardship full time.  When the opportunity came, I ran for City Council, was elected president of the council in the first year of my first term, and served two terms as president.  I am passionate about Denver and enjoy the commitment and passion of all our citizens for our city.  Being a military dependent, I never had a hometown.  Now I do.  I want to take care of it.</p>

                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">There are three issues I hear most: 1. Traffic 2. Traffic  3. Traffic.  Long time dwellers are feeling overwhelmed with the rise of population and development growth in our city.  Our roads are getting choked, and something has to be done to alleviate congestion.  We have a built road infrastructure that can’t be widened for the most part and anyway, more car space just means more cars. We are fortunate to have a thriving economy and lifestyle that entices people to move to Denver, but we need to preserve that which brings people here in the first place, which means hard decisions about how we build our city to grow well.</p>
                <p class="answer">I am committed to finding modern solutions to getting around town in our daily lives with convenient, inexpensive alternatives to the car, at least for some of our trips:  bus-on-demand; walkability, bikeability.  I recently wrote a guest commentary for the Post called The First Mile, and our dearth of convenient, choice-riders’ for in-town transit. I’ve been working on public/private partnerships for in town mobility.  We can’t sustain merely government responsibility for mobility.  Reluctance to increased taxes has proven that.  If we can’t fund government to do it, we have to look to other opportunities.</p>

                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Managing our Development Success:  District 5 has many developments occurring in  long standing vacant and alternate use properties, i.e. 9th and Colo Blvd, Boulevard One (the conversion from Buckley Annex) and soon Lowry Vista. It's been a shock to the system for many constituents, particularly as many of my neighborhoods were the suburbs of earlier decades.  Neighbor participation in designing these projects is essential to create livable, urban design of great new places without compromising the livability and design of established neighborhoods.</p>
                <p class="answer">2. I am working on an analysis of the Sharing Economy and its shift to traditional commerce.  The two areas that have come to the forefront first are home-sharing and ride-sharing.  I've created a council committee to look at effects it has on residential areas, transportation, and am working with neighborhoods for possible new recognition and regulation of home-sharing and exploring opportunities for new ride-sharing.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">See above to the number one issue in my district.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">64% of Denver’s homeless are families with children.  The most common causes of homelessness are job loss, cost of housing and marriage break-ups.</p>
                <p class="answer">The best model for curtailing homelessness is a program called Housing First.  If you can find adequate housing for people first, they can begin to stabilize their lives.  If you provide wrap-around services for job training and counseling, substance-abuse counseling, and other social services it’s the fastest route to ending their cycle of need.  Denver’s Road Home, private and public agencies are working hard to find sustainable revenues to provide this much needed housing.  In the short term adequate shelter is necessary and the city has been providing that through various temporary locations around the city.  We are looking for a site to build a 24-hour shelter with companion services to help with homelessness and looking at creative ways other cities have addressed the issue.  In addition, we need to find better avenues for incenting builders of affordable housing.</p>
                <p class="answer">As for panhandling, the city has implemented as many rules as they can to try and prevent it without compromising free speech rights.  We are trying to encourage people not to contribute to panhandlers, but instead to put that gift toward established charities and programs that can provide benefits to all homeless people, not just the few.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do.  While it can gall a person to get a ticket through this process, there are safeguards and many eyes on the camera shots to insure that the infraction has occurred.  The research definitely shows it has positive effects on reducing running of red lights, a serious threat to life and limb. Speeding cameras that will produce tickets to speeders are requested by my neighborhoods often.  We don’t have nearly enough of those to meet the demand.  The ticket for stopping inside the pedestrian walk way at traffic lights is the most controversial, but our disabled community, pedestrians, bicyclists, parents with strollers are the biggest fans of that aspect.  We all have to anticipate that we must stop before the white line when approaching a red light.  It’s basic driver’s education that we learned as new drivers.  No driver is ticketed unless both front wheels are over the white line.  When a light is red, the crosswalk belongs to pedestrians, not cars.  I’ve seen horrific videos of drivers barely missing moms with strollers and bicyclists by not stopping where they should.  It’s a matter of paying better attention as drivers. We want to increase our pedestrian friendliness in our city.</p>
                <p class="answer">The ultimate goal of this program is to put it out of business.  If there weren’t so many infractions, there wouldn’t be enough ticket revenue to pay for the program.  The idea that we should reduce enforcement against law-breaking because people don’t like to be caught makes no sense.</p>

                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">Accept.</p>
                <p class="answer">1.  Council is required by law to set salaries for the next term.  Here’s the history: City Council has had a total 12.94 % raise in the last 8 years.  That’s 1.61% average/yr.  Meanwhile, city employees have received an accumulated 20.1% raise in those 8 years, which constitutes a 2.57% average/year which itself  hasn’t kept up with the cost of living.</p>
                <p class="answer">This raise we voted on is intended to catch up council raises somewhat with the cost of living. The recent council raise of 10.3% is for the whole 4 years for the next term of council from 2015-2019, received in the first two years and nothing in the second two.  So when it all plays out in 2019, council will have received an increase of 23.24% in raise in 12 years.   That averages to 1.93% per year.  Pretty modest and below the rise in cost of living.</p>
                <p class="answer">2.  We want to guard against making it so that only people of some means are able to run for office- or only people who have a retirement income or income supporting spouse, etc. Younger and older people of all means and all marital status should be able to serve.  Nor should council members have to have a full time job outside of their public service work, making city council a part time effort. It’s more than a full time job.  It’s an “all time” job.</p>
                <p class="answer">3.  Raises are computed on a base.  If the base was wrong, that’s another question, but the deliberations when it was set were done thoughtfully, considering the many factors associated with the job and its requirements and comparing the salaries with state and national salaries for the same position.  Denver Council salaries are in the middle of the pack in the comparisons.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Chief White has done a remarkable job of putting more officers on our streets and converting civilian-type jobs back to civilian employees, freeing up uniformed officers for actual enforcement.  Also while still having some glitches, the addition of body cameras should have important effects on parsing out police interactions with citizens, and good information on controversial situations.</p>
                <p class="answer">There’s always more that can be done to improve any department, and further training and information for officers are in the works.  The police have become our new social case-workers, and our jails the new mental institutions.  Police haven’t been traditionally trained to deal with their increasingly social/psychological problem interactions these days.  Those are encounters with individuals with substance abuse disorders, mental disorders, family dysfunction, suicides and myriad other social psychological distresses.  There is considerable activity in the justice department both in enforcement and courts to address how best to provide effective services and train police in how to deal with these new expectations for their job.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">Council has an important role to play in over-seeing reforms in our jail culture.  We are members of the committee following the consultants’ analysis of the issues and will continue to monitor the extent of the issue and what best practices can be put in place to prevent abuse.  The famous Zimbardo experiments (<a href="http://www.simplepsychology.org/Zimbardo.html">simplepsychology.org/Zimbardo.html</a>) showed that an environment where humans have control over other humans may be structurally conducive to abusive interactions, and so these cannot be blamed just on purported sadistic characteristics of the participants.  How we alter such an environment is a societal dilemma.  Re-organizing the incarceration environment has been successfully done in some European countries, but it takes a cultural attitude shift.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">The funding for the National Western Center hasn’t been fully decided on yet.  There is a request to the state for RTA funds and a significant contribution from the National Western Center organization itself, along with discussions about how lodging and other taxes might be used.  There may also be bond opportunities, tax-increment financing opportunities and other avenues to explore. In the end I expect the new concepts and activities for the National Western Center should create an ample return on any investment.</p>

                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Hancock is a man who cares about all citizens and has created many overdue initiatives to support long-neglected neighborhoods, enterprises and populations.  He has been more modest about these than some, so perhaps isn’t always recognized as well for his accomplishments.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">The salaries, benefits and due process available to Denver’s civil service employees are as good as any collective bargaining  could provide, so I don’t believe that there would be significant gain for them with collective bargaining.  But if the majority voted for them, it should be considered.</p>

                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">They are working very well from all reports, and we continue to regulate as we see new areas of need, such as the ban on home extraction and the proposed ordinance to limit unlicensed collaborative personal grows of more than 36 plants.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">We should not allow public consumption of marijuana.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe it’s a good idea for the 16th street mall except for the possible effects it might have if it moves to neighboring downtown streets.  This still needs to be analyzed more.  I haven’t made up my mind about city parks.</p>

                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">As I have both initiated and supported along with all of council for the last three budget cycles, we need more budget for traffic engineering, transit, development of complete streets, and pedestrian and bicycle access and safety.</p>

                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">Denver is a great place to live, and we need to maintain that characteristic. While our City is experiencing a strong resurgence from the depths of the recent recession, there are challenges before us that if not met promptly and wisely threaten to derail us. The 36 years I spent  focusing on District 6 and city issues as a journalist, while meeting the challenges of keeping a small business thriving through good times and bad have given me a unique perspective that I think will serve me well in helping meet the challenges that lay ahead.</p>

                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">The biggest challenge facing District 6 is the pressure of uncontrolled development, both residential and commercial, threatening the character of our established neighborhoods. While Blueprint Denver considers the neighborhoods in District 6 as areas of stability, there is tremendous change under way from construction of ever-larger homes in our neighborhoods to expected increases in density along arterials and around light rail stations. I will continue to fight for sensible development guided by what is good for our neighborhoods.. I will expect current zoning to be honored, and that upzoning's not take place unless a clear change in relevant conditions can be documented. I will be proactive and bring developers and neighbors to the table together in the earliest stages of proposed projects to pave the way for compromise instead of litigation. I will insist that a robust pubic process be part of the planned revamping of Blueprint Denver, and am especially interested in the transportation plan that will be part of that effort. </p>

                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Congestion on our roadways, leading to difficult traveling, and overflow traffic in our neighborhoods is of great concern. I will call for a transportation summit bringing together all pieces of the people-moving puzzle – RTD, the City, the cab companies, the online transportation platforms, the bicycle and pedestrian advocacy groups, and organizations like Transportation Solutions with the goal of creating an efficient and cost-effective transportation network that will get Denver residents and visitors where they need to go at reasonable cost in reasonable timeframe.</p>
                <p class="answer">We must expand our inventory of available housing to reflect the full variety of price points, so Denver has a welcome mat out inviting all economic groups to make our city home. Affordable housing must be a part of the Transit Oriented Development projects planned in the areas surrounding present and future rail stations as the FasTracks project is built out.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">As mentioned above, the challenges brought by growth are putting a strain on Denver, and we must bring relief. Without adequate housing available, if large businesses want to move to Denver many employees will need to find homes outside our city limits, and with our transportation system nearing gridlock their trips to and from work will not be easy. I fear we're at a point where large employers may look at Denver and think "Let's give them a few years to get their act together, and then look again."</p>
                <p class="answer">In addition to the Transportation Summit I spoke about above, I would rethink Denver's current parking requirements for new developments to ensure that parking be fully accounted for on site. I would require parking and traffic pattern studies at developer's expense for any large scale project.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">We must continue to expand housing opportunities and services for our at-risk populations - it is the right thing to do, and it is cost-effective. To not provide physical or mental health services and then deal with crisis conditions in emergency rooms is fiscally irresponsible and poor medical practice. We must expand job training services to get people back on their feet and back into the workforce. I am not in favor of camping bans that drive the homeless out of one neighborhood into another. The only solution is adequate housing and support services.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer"> No. I think it is purely a revenue tool that does not lead to slower speeds. I would favor an expansion of the reminder signs that show your speed as above or below the posted limit. </p>

                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do not think City Council should be setting its own salary. I would favor it being set by statute or an objective third party. I would have voted against the increase. I will look at options for re turning the increase to the general fund or using it to establish a fund for needed District projects not funded otherwise.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer"> I believe more work needs to be done in rebuilding trust between Denver citizens and the Denver Police Department. We, as citizens, need to appreciate and show respect for the difficult, dangerous job our peace officers do on a daily basis, and in return DPD officers need to show respect for the civil rights of all citizens with whom they come in contact. DPD should continue it’s recruitment of diverse officers, and training to respect all cultures.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">Council must ensure that adequate funds are available so that sufficient personnel are available for staffing. Council must also do everything possible to ensure that the proper management is in place throughout the structure of the Sheriff’s Department.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am comfortable with extending the lodging and car rental taxes. I fear the project will end up being even more costly than planned, as projects of this scope often are, and will look to keep overruns to a minimum wherever possible by carefully examining any related contracts that come before council.</p>

                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">It appears Mayor Hancock has upped his game as far as listening to the community after some very bad starts. I spoke loudly in opposition to his decision to sidestep the City Charter at Hentzell Park, and felt Parks & Rec. moved too ham-handedly in trying to put the City Loop project at City Park. Lauri Dannemiller in Parks and Brad Buchannan in Planning are saying some good things as far as involving neighborhoods in their processes, but only time will tell. I think the Mayor does a good job promoting the city as an attractive destination for the business community, and the delivery of basic services seems to be running smoothly.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would be comfortable with civil service employees being given the right to organize a union if they so desire.</p>

                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think the regulations are working in general. I would favor increased attention to the edibles market to ensure that they are safe for adults and will not get in the hands of children.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer"> I am not in favor of public consumption at this point. We are still early in this experiment with legal marijuana, and I would like more time to look at the data to assess effects to date as well as any unexpected outcomes. </p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">While I would love to see tobacco smoking go away, and feel it may be justified to do so as a public health threat, I do not feel a need to support either of those policies.</p>

                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">We need to establish a reserve fund so that we are able to maintain public safety employment levels during down economic times. We need to look at increasing our general reserve fund as well so as to have funds available for needed infrastructure repair as well.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Liz Adams</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">Denver is a great place to live, work, and raise a family. I am running for Denver City Council because I want to ensure that the residents, businesses and schools of District 6 and Denver will be well represented and have their needs addressed.</p>
                <p class="answer">I have experience working for the non-partisan Legislative Council policy staff, as an aide to state legislators, and serving on community boards - including the East Angel Friends and Alumni Foundation and Real Colorado Soccer. I want to use my twenty-four years of professional experience, community leadership skills, and passion for Denver to be a meaningful part of the decision-making process that will keep our city great. </p>

                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Increased traffic is the most common complaint I hear from people in District 6. As more people move to Denver, we see a corresponding increase in traffic. Unfortunately, our public transportation system has not yet kept up with our growth. We need to examine ways to improve access to light rail, busses, and the new commuter rail. If elected, I will work closely with RTD to ensure that people have access to efficient and timely public transportation. I would also support continued efforts to make areas pedestrian friendly, create more bike trails and designate more bike lanes. Finally, I would support further efforts to educate our citizens about the value of public and shared transportation.</p>

                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">Affordable housing in Denver is of particular concern to me.  As demand increases and supply of rental and for sale units tightens, so many of our young people and seniors are priced out of the housing market. There are many pieces to the housing puzzle, including potential changes to the state law regarding construction defects as well as a sustainable funding stream for affordable housing. We also need to encourage public/private partnerships to create developments with more diversity of price. Last fall the mayor released Housing Denver – a plan to address the cost and availability of housing in Denver. I would support aggressive implementation of the plan’s recommendations.</p>
                <p class="answer">I would also like to work with the East Evans Business Association, the Office of Economic Development and other stakeholders to create sustainable redevelopment of the East Evans corridor from Colorado to Quebec.  This is an area that has great potential, but has been neglected over the years.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Four of the biggest north-south thoroughfares in Denver – Downing, University, Colorado and Monaco Boulevards - cut right through District 6. Fewer parking spaces, deteriorating roads, crowded intersections and greater pedestrian hazards are just a few of the downsides of living or working in a growing city. But these challenges are in many ways opportunities for city leadership to really re-think our relationship with the car, create more pedestrian-friendly spaces and truly maximize the potential of transit-oriented development, which serves to bring people closer to the mass transit hubs. And - as I’ve mentioned elsewhere in this survey, one of my goals is to work with RTD and others to realize Denver’s full potential with respect to mass transit.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">The complexities of homelessness – aging, mental health, and unemployment - aren’t going to be fixed with any one policy solution. Our responsibility as a city is to provide as many options possible to keep our homeless population connected with services.  This issue really is a metropolitan one. I would like to see Denver reach out to neighboring municipalities to partner on finding solutions.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">If the point is to make drivers go slower and drive more carefully, I believe we could do more than use photo radar to fine drivers after the fact. I have some friends who have resolved never to pay their photo radar fines and others who pay them every time. This kind of self-enforcement isn’t the best way to improve road safety. As for red-light cameras, I’m aware that some cities have installed them only to remove them at a later date. I am undecided on red-light cameras, but if I were shown the evidence that they reduce traffic accidents and running red lights, I would be inclined to support them.</p>

                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">While economic times are improving, the proposed pay raises for Denver’s elected officials send the wrong message to the citizens of Denver. The City Council is about public service, not a salary.  If elected, I will donate each year an amount equal to the difference of the 2014 salary during my entire four-year term.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe it is too early to tell if Chief White’s reforms have worked.  Changing the culture in any organization takes time and those in the organization need to feel supported as changes are instituted.  I believe we need to do more to reform the culture at DPD, but at the same time we need to support the chief and officers as they focus on their many efforts to improve the department.  As a potential future city official, I would need a great deal more information and data before saying what more needs to be done.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">Earlier this year I toured the jail downtown and it was an eye-opening experience. The Denver Sheriffs work in a highly challenging and potentially volatile work environment every day. The rate of abuse and allegations of mismanagement are nonetheless concerning. If I am elected, I would be supportive of an effort to address the systematic and procedural changes that need to occur so that the Sheriffs can do their job more effectively.  We also need to ensure that the Sheriffs who perform poorly are dealt with appropriately.   The city council needs to continue to monitor the situation with our Sheriffs and work with management and employees to identify solutions that will help us avoid situations like the ones that have plagued the department over the past few years.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am generally inclined to support the proposal to extend the lodging and car rental tax, but I would like to see specifics before making a full-fledged endorsement. I believe that National Western Master Plan is a great addition to the growth of our city and that we should work to fund it.</p>

                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Of all his good attributes, I am mostly impressed with Mayor Hancock’s enthusiasm for Denver and its possibilities as a world-class city. His optimism, energy and work ethic on behalf of our city is equal to none.  That strength, however, has contributed to a weakness.  In his enthusiasm to move forward many citizens feel left behind.  While he has made an effort to reach out through “Cabinet in the Community” and other programs, many people do not feel that they have really been heard - especially when it comes to issues regarding growth and development. I believe Mayor Hancock should continue to lead an effort among the administration, City Council and city departments to work toward more inclusive involvement for our citizens.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Denver voters have twice turned down an amendment to our city charter to allow non-uniformed city workers to collective bargain.  I believe that we do need to provide “a seat at the table” for our city workers, but do not support a third attempt to amend the charter.  I believe a third attempt to amend the charter would be costly and contentious.  I would rather concentrate time and effort on an alternative solution by looking at successful city/employee relationships in other cities and states as well as identifying the specific employment issues that exist in Denver and addressing them head on.</p>

                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">Developing policy for the production and sale of marijuana in Denver is a huge task, and I believe the city is doing well so far. As far as changes go, I would like to see more communication with the community and neighbors about facility and retail licensing. If there’s one aspect of our marijuana policy that might need some scrutiny, it’s THC-infused edibles. As I’m out communicating with my neighbors on the campaign trail, I am hearing concern about how kids have easier access to these products.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would oppose any attempt to lift or loosen Denver’s prohibition of public marijuana use. Marijuana and THC-infused products should be regulated just like we do alcohol – as a controlled substance for consumption by adults in appropriate environments.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">To include public streets in Denver’s already robust non-smoking ordinance might cause some controversy and might be legally challenged.  I would consider a ban on smoking but need to know much more about the origin of the proposal.    We should be very cognizant that smokers will find a place to smoke, regardless of the regulations. One downside to this proposal is that we might be looking at smokers congregating just outside of the 50-foot zone up and down the NE/SW streets. Several concentrations of smokers might defeat the purpose of making the mall more enjoyable for everyone and might upset businesses on those NE/SW streets just outside the no-smoking zone. Rather than have these smokers determine their own smoking zones, we might want to consider creating a small number of clearly marked “smoking allowed” zones.</p>
                <p class="answer">Until I see data on both sides of the issue, I am undecided about banning smoking in our parks.</p>

                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">If I am elected, I will look at the budget as a whole and decide where we can create efficiencies, squeeze more revenue and remove waste. Unfortunately, making changes in spending priorities is a zero-sum situation. I’m eager to take a deep dive into our city budget and begin to hear from various stakeholders how best to re-prioritize resources. However, if there was one budget priority I would emphasize over all others it would be to encourage and incentivize our thousands of small business owners in Denver to open, expand, sell more product and employ more of our citizens.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Jake Viano</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">The number one reason I joined the race was watching the irresponsible development going on throughout Denver. I moved here 12 years ago from the Chicago after falling in love with Denver; and to escape 12 hours of gridlock. Now it seems as if that congestion is coming here. I have many detailed ideas on how we can work to make growth sustainable so that we don’t follow the mistakes of our fellow cities.</p>
                <p class="answer">The second reason is that I feel we have been either poorly or misrepresented at all levels of government for far too long. Having lived in various areas of Denver, I’ve had countless calls to council members go unanswered. If elected, I have a plan to change that in Dist 7.</p>

                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Two issues facing the district are equally important. The first is over development / road congestion and the second is affordable housing. While most believe that the solutions to these cannot happen in synchronicity, I believe they can. To address overdevelopment, I believe we should be incentivizing auxiliary dwelling units (ADU’s) through tax incentives for the building. These are approved for many single family homes and are essentially coach houses. They create a more decentralized form of it and would assist in the affordable housing crisis. Next, incentivizing developers to build live-work spaces and then incentivizing the purchase of them is yet another tool in the tool box. These were very effective 100 years ago by urban planners and are still effective at reducing car trips per day on our roads. Moreover, they promote and facilitate small boutique businesses. Protected bicycle lanes will also assist in reducing congestion. All of these coupled with PSA and incentives for short term car rentals such as Car2togo will, I believe, help us manage our traffic better.</p>
                <p class="answer">As far as affordable housing, the model being employed by San Francisco has shown some success at helping to keep rental rates manageable. I will look to assemble a committee to study this model and others in an effort to effectively address this pending issue.</p>

                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">The Denver Police are for the most part a highly professional organization. These are men and women doing a dangerous job for often times not enough money. But as with any large organization, there can be some bad apples. I will work to ensure that body cameras become standard issue equipment on all patrol officers. I believe that these are a win-win in that the numbers false accusations of wrong doing by citizens and police alike will dwindle. Furthermore, there will be a drop in the costs incurred by the tax payers for lengthy trials with “he said, she said” as well as a drop in police brutality lawsuits against the city.</p>
                <p class="answer">Secondly, I have a plan that would help streamline the often burdensome regulations that make opening small businesses a daunting task. Essentially, this would be an office that would mirror a private consulting firm for cutting the red tape of applications, permits and inspections. The difference would be that 1) it would not have the heightened price tag that a private firm has for overhead and profit and 2) it would be staffed with veterans of the Community Planning and Development Services who are well versed in the labyrinth of protocols for licensing and inspecting new businesses. I believe that we owe this to the job creators here in Denver to help them create more opportunities.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">As mentioned above, incentives for ADU’s are key. Secondly, I would mirror Chris Nevitt’s work on the Parking Area Management Plan that was implemented on a section of Broadway. In short, it removed redundant loading zones, increased meter times, and located new, previously unrecognized parking places. I had suggested this same concept in my website back in Oct and am thrilled to see that Councilman Nevitt had the same idea. This is common sense, neighborhood leadership at its finest. </p>

                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">Homelessness is an extremely complex issue. Each person has a different story, varied experiences and widely varying reasons as to why they are now on the streets. After meeting with area leaders at different shelters, it’s clear that many of our fellow citizens who are homeless suffer from mental health issues and/or chemical addictions. That said, I would like to see a stronger strategic alliance formed between already existing foundations that help the homeless to get off the street and the city. After all, this is the number one mission for these organizations and foundation. This is what they eat, sleep and breathe. And this is what they do best. Thus, we should look to them for guidance in this solving this crisis.</p>
                <p class="answer">After having read about Social Impact Bonds, I’m excited to see the initial success results. If promising, these could become yet another tool in combating chronic homelessness and helping our fellow Coloradans who need it most.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">Absolutely not!</p>

                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, I have already voiced publicly my support reversing the pay raise. </p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that the reforms implemented will take time to work. As with any organization of this size, changing the culture can be a complex and time consuming undertaking. Also, I believe that there is always room for improvement. I applaud Chief White’s accomplishments in this area and will push for continuous improvement.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Council’s role should be that of a partner with the Manager of Safety as well one of unilateral oversight. In essence, the Council should allow the MOS to do her job but maintain the authority to step in should there be reason for concern.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">The only way I would support the use of extended lodging and car rental taxes is if there existed verbiage in the final draft that effected the immediate cessation of the tax extension after the initial capitol were paid down. This would stop over taxation creep.</p>
                <p class="answer">Private bonds are always an alternative to the proposed method.</p>

                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">Mayor Hancock comes from meager beginnings having at one point in his childhood lived in a hotel with his many siblings and a single parent. It is these struggles that give our Mayor a unique perspective to lead from. I would easily put this as his greatest strength.</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that his greatest weakness surrounds the media scandal that broke shortly after he won election as Mayor.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Whether or not the current system works well is a question best left to the stakeholders. As far as granting CB rights, I would so long as there are terms in the agreement that would ultimately protect public health and safety.</p>

                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that overall they are with the exception of the following: The over taxation of recreational marijuana I believe is hurting us. Although Denver is not wholly responsible for this over taxation, the City has a part in it. It is a widely held belief that the black market thrives under conditions such as these. I also feel the City needs a sunset ordinance similar to the one proposed at the State. This would help cannabis industry business owners save money and time by not having to constantly adjust to rapidly changing regulations. Lastly, I feel that the marijuana industry is treated unfairly and with bias by various city departments performing a myriad of inspections. This needs to change as they are legitimate businesses and should therefore be treated like any other.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">Due to the psychoactive effects of marijuana and its smoke, I don’t believe that it should be treated similarly to tobacco. Along these lines, public consumption by one person can place those who are required to test for drugs with their employers at risk. I fully support public consumption on private property e.g. front and back porches/yards, but cannot support public consumption in the streets.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">No.</p>

                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that we need to spend more on training our Deputy Sherriff’s. If implemented properly, this should result in fewer legal liabilities and an ever more professional organization.</p>
                <p class="answer">The Community Planning and Development Department needs more plan reviewers and engineers to review plans for new structures. Currently there is an approx 4 month permitting process. This is stifling growth and is costly to entrepreneurs and business owners.</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that the city needs to phase out Enterprise programs which could cause a potential liability to the tax payers. These sorts of endeavors are best left to the private sector as the City should be concerned with governing and not operating services mimicking private businesses.</p>
                <p class="answer">I think that the money allocated under Cultural and Entertainment line items should be slowly phased out with a transition to NGO’s and the private sector. This would effect no loss of the programs, yet help us realize a savings. Those savings could easily be put towards early childhood education for starters.</p>
                <p class="answer">The recently approved 10.3% raise for the City Council, Auditor and May needs to be reversed. All future raises for these offices should happen only after city workers receive raises that are commensurate with a mean of inflation and local cost of living increase. Furthermore, they should also be put to a referendum for the people to approve.</p>
                <p class="answer">Unless the pay to participate composting program can show substantial growth in short order, I feel that this too should be phased out. It’s difficult to imagine the logic behind diesel guzzling trucks transporting compost material across Denver when most composting can easily take place in one’s own back yard. Again, I would push to allocate these funds towards programs such as early childhood education among others.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Mickki Langston</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I’m running for council because the decisions we make impact every business owner and neighbor in the city. Through my work with Mile High Business Alliance and related involvement with local policy efforts, I’ve seen how critical it is for us to have a diversity of voices and perspectives as we make decisions about how we use our shared resources  and to solve important issues such as affordable housing, public safety, and building resilient economies.  For many years, I’ve been encouraged by my grassroots colleagues and small business owners to bring my unique perspective and vision for a healthier Denver to public office, and I’m thrilled by the opportunity to expand my work on behalf of Denver.</p>

                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">There are several pressing issues in District 7, and many of them are related to the huge growth Denver is currently experiencing. The negative impacts of growth include traffic congestion, stress on parking and other transportation infrastructure, and affordability of housing. As a council member, I will work to thoughtfully plan for new growth, improve transportation infrastructure, and build sustainable funding for a variety of affordable housing solutions throughout Denver.</p>
                <p class="answer">Most importantly, we must ensure we have attainable housing for the diversity of working families in our neighborhoods. This must be addressed with both local policy (continuing to refine Denver’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, supporting construction defects reform, and balancing renter’s and homeowner’s rights with the concerns of developers and their financiers), and local investment (increasing funding to affordable housing, down payment assistance, overall increase of housing stock)</p>

                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">We need to improve our transportation infrastructure to help residents get to work and relieve congestion. This includes increasing bike lanes (and safety!), improving sidewalk infrastructure (especially in the west side), and increasing use of public transit.</p>
                <p class="answer">I’m quite passionate about healthy, local food systems, and will work in the district to increase access to healthy food, especially in neighborhoods without farmer’s markets or grocery stores. Proper nutrition supports healthy families, helps children learn in school, and reduces other impacts of poverty and stress for working families.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">1) Convene neighbors on land use and transportation planning and use input to prioritize needs and concerns</p>
                <p class="answer">2) Support more dialogue between the real estate development community and the existing neighborhoods, to help increase housing stock in a more positive way</p>
                <p class="answer">3) Learn from and promote how other cities have successfully addressed parking and traffic congestion, and work within the community to apply those lessons to Denver.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">The root of homelessness is systemic poverty and the various challenges associated with it. It’s clearly not enough to continue one-off service delivery. We must partner with our community stakeholders to incorporate the formerly homeless into our communities in meaningful ways, including permanent housing and social services to disrupt these negative cycles and take care of the currently homeless members of our community.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I understand this is a contentious issue, and no one wants a ticket. But if electronic enforcement is able to increase safety and reduce harm to everyone sharing the road, then I may support its use.</p>

                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">The current City Council has already passed (with 8 in favor) the salary increase for the next body of council members. If elected, I would accept the given salary.</p>
                <p class="answer">I would also support a review and possible refinement of the compensation process. As Executive Director of an organization I started, I recognize the challenges in setting appropriate compensation, and the inherent problems with having the beneficiaries of that process be the ones setting the rates. In my organization, the Board of Directors makes the final decision about my compensation, so we can ensure integrity in the process and set compensation which is appropriate and sustainable for the organization.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">While our police force has become more effective with Chief White’s reforms, there is more work to be done to nurture healthy, mutually-supportive relationships between Denver Police and the community-at-large. Building trust takes more than policy reform, but that is a critical place to start, and I’m glad to see the direction we’re going.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">Reform starts with accountability. City Council is responsible for ensuring that our government is administrating our public safety agencies properly, and should continue to examine instances of inmate abuse and hold administrative leaders accountable for repairing the cultural and systemic problems at the root of these issues.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, I think tourism should be used to pay for tourism infrastructure.</p>

                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">His primary focus – on strengthening Denver’s economy – has benefited us in many ways, as Denver is growing and our unemployment rate is lower than the national average. However, this growth is bringing other challenges at a pace we’re not yet keeping up with. I think citizens feel a lack of control and input over the changes in Denver, and that’s a common challenge when you have a bold leader striding in a single direction.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support all employees organizing and using collective bargaining, if they choose to.</p>

                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">It is important to ensure that the city oversees a responsible implementation of marijuana sales. While the city has taken some important steps in educating the public about health and safety concerns, we can do more to ensure that marijuana, especially edibles, is used safely, responsibly, and kept out of children’s hands.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">We lack legal places for people to meet and consume marijuana. I would like to experiment with a limited number of legal, public spaces, to see what makes sense for our neighborhoods. I think this will help address some of the concerns of neighbors who see groups of people renting homes to consume marijuana.</p>
                <p class="answer">I’d be interested to see what the impact of these places would have on the surrounding businesses, and how other cities incorporate public consumption and cafes. I want Denver to learn from the experiences of other places and for us to do a great job incorporating marijuana into our city.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Tobacco smoke is a public health issue, and I support restricting public consumption in order to limit exposure to others, especially for children and people dealing with health issues.</p>

                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">My priorities are, first, ensuring we have adequate funding for our basic infrastructure such as street repair and maintenance, and public safety services by police and firefighters. Then I would like to see improved funding for economic development and affordable housing, followed by advancing our multi-modal transportation system and solving Denver’s homelessness.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Michael J. Levy</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">Hello I’m Michael Levy and I would love to have your vote and your support, but NOT your money.  I'm the only District 7 candidate who is not taking donations of any kind from voters or any special interests.  I'm here to serve the residents of District 7 (not the other way around).  I'm running because it's time to stop auctioning off our public offices to the highest bidder.  I don't want to be sitting on your city council, and wondering whom I might owe for a particular vote (other than the actual voters of District 7).</p>
                <p class="answer">As of today $193,000 has been donated to the other District 7 candidates.  That same money could have been used to purchase 965 Chromebooks for DPS Schools.  That same money could have also been used to pay for 10 para professional teachers, (which goes towards helping to reduce child to teacher ratios in our schools).</p>
                <p class="answer">Instead of making a donation to any campaign, please consider sending $25 to the PTA at your local K-12 school instead.  (If they don't have a PTA, just send it directly to the school).  I can assure you that our schools need your money more than any of the City Council candidates who are running for office.</p>
                <p class="answer">I’m also running because I believe city government needs to be MUCH more responsive to the people that we work for (that’s YOU by the way).  I own an emergency roadside assistance company for motorcyclists.  In my business, customers get extremely upset if we don’t pick up the phone in a timely manner and then get them off the side of the road very quickly.  It’s my intent to treat the residents of District 7 with that same sort of respect and urgency.</p>
                <p class="answer">But let’s not wait until the May 5th election to start solving problems.  If there is a problem in your neighborhood that you need help with, email me the details to <a href="mailto:mlevy@michaelfordistrict7.com">mlevy@michaelfordistrict7.com</a> and let’s get to work, right now, on making our district an even better place to live, today!</p>

                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">In my opinion the biggest issue affecting District 7 (as well as Denver in its entirety), is the lack of affordable housing.  As rents and home prices continue to rise substantially, more people are getting completely priced out of the Denver housing market.</p>
                <p class="answer">Most others on the campaign trail agree that more affordable housing in Denver is one of the biggest issues as well.  However, most other candidates are advocating for either a) solutions that won’t work (IHO) and or worse b) solutions that involve new taxes.</p>
                <p class="answer">My action plan to help generate more affordable housing for Denver, but will not necessarily be limited to, the following:</p>
                <p class="answer">1) Modify the current Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to also include rental housing in this ordinance.  The IHO, as it stands now, only applies to units for sale, and only helped to bring on a whopping 16 affordable housing units in the City of Denver last year.  If the IHO is modified as I intend to propose, my proposals will help to bring on a substantial number of affordable housing rental units as well.  That said, the new modifications to the Inclusionary Home Ordinance (that went into effect on December 1st) are not likely to bring on many more affordable For Sale housing units onto the market anytime soon, until…</p>
                <p class="answer">2) We Pass Senate Bill 177.  This bill will make independent mediation / arbitration the preferred method of resolving disputes between condo owners and developers.  I live in a condo and I’m certainly sensitive to this issue.  That said, anytime two parties can resolve an issue through arbitration, things are going to be mutually resolved much more quickly, than if both sides are constantly suing each other.  Hence, I support the passage of Senate Bill 177 which would alleviate one of the primary hurdles, which has been a major impediment to new multi-family housing development in the City of Denver.</p>
                <p class="answer">3)  Redevelop Denver City and County Owned Property.  The City and County of Denver own a number of underutilized properties that can and should be redeveloped to include a significant affordable housing component.  New City and County buildings could and should incorporate administrative city services on the lower floors and affordable multi-family housing units up above.  Hence as soon as possible, I recommend that a complete audit of City and County owned properties take place, in order to determine which properties might be the best fits to include an affordable housing component.  From a security standpoint, residents in new city owned developments could access their units through separate and secure entrances.</p>

                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">1) Advocating for an increase in K-12 funding, so that DPS can hire more teachers in order to help reduce student to teacher ratios.</p>
                <p class="answer">2) A much stronger focus on RESPONSIBLE development, which better addresses the parking and traffic from new developments that can overwhelm neighborhoods</p>
                <p class="answer">2.5) Provide District 7 residents with a much more responsive city councilman.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Are you as tired of being stuck in traffic on Lincoln, Logan and I-25 as I am?  Responsible development can certainly be a part of the solution, rather than a contributor to the problem.  My recommendations for dealing with these issues include:</p>
                <p class="answer">- Require higher parking ratios for new developments.  Parking structures should also accommodate adequate free parking for visitors.</p>
                <p class="answer">- Require developers of multi-family rental real estate to include parking in with the rent.  When parking is optional, renters often choose to park on the street in order to save money, which only further clogs up our side streets (and often inhibits the ability of owners of single family homes, to park in front of their own homes).</p>
                <p class="answer">- Build more safe and secure parking at light rail stations.  As our roads get more clogged, if there is more safe and secure parking at light rail stations, more people will choose to park their cars and hop on the light rail.  Additionally more residential and commercial real estate developers in turn will seek out more properties which are closer to light rail stations.</p>
                <p class="answer">- Announcing “ABC” (Anything But Cars) First Fridays!  Currently Denver has a once a year Bike to Work event.  But we need to get people out of our cars more often, in order to make choosing alternative forms of transportation a more of an ingrained habit.  So starting Friday, April 3rd (and every first Friday thereafter), just plan to find an “ABC” alternative (i.e. bike, light rail, bus or walk) in order to get to work or school.  The more we do this, the more we’ll all realize how really liberating it is to leave our cars at home.  Also be sure to check out great organizations like Bike Denver, and get involved to help make Denver an even better Bike Friendly city!</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">My sister and I were raised by a single mom, who often struggled to keep a roof over our heads.  If not for some of the public assistance help of food stamps and welfare that we received, my sister, my mom and I… all very well could have become homeless.  Hence I certainly understand the plight of struggling families.</p>
                <p class="answer">That said, if you are struggling financially, or if you are homeless now (or know someone who is), you obviously can’t wait for Denver to build all this new affordable housing we keep hearing so much about.  But the fact is that there ARE a number of readily accessible public resources available in Denver that can help people break the cycle of homelessness.  However, the people whom are usually the most stressed about money, often don’t know just where to start looking for help.  The resources below are a good start:</p>
                <p class="answer"><a href="http://www.DenverRoadHome.org">www.DenverRoadHome.org</a> (Tremendous amount of housing and public assistance resources)</p>
                <p class="answer"><a href="http://www.coloradopeak.secure.force.com">www.coloradopeak.secure.force.com</a> (If you are homeless, you are definitely eligible for Medicaid health and dental coverage for you and your kids)  720-944-3666</p>
                <p class="answer">Food and Cash Assistance:  Same contact info as Colorado Peak above.</p>
                <p class="answer">Once on City Council, I also plan on proposing that Denver use at least ten percent of the tax revenue generated from recreational marijuana sales, in order to address the growing amount of homeless people who are now coming to Denver from out of state.  According to Urban Peak (a local non-profit serving young people in Denver), 1 in 3 new young people they are serving, have traveled to Denver specifically because marijuana was legalized in Colorado.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">Absolutely NOT!  I would propose that the City of Denver end the use of red light cameras immediately.  Then I will help box up the cameras and ship them back personally.  I believe the primary motive for red light cameras is to generate revenue for municipalities, and not to benefit public safety.  Flashing speed signs (like the one on south bound York Street just past the Botanic Gardens) are likely much more effective at getting folks to slow down than the red light cameras.  And while we are at it, I would certainly vote to eliminate all the “gotcha” photo enforcement vans that are often parked on our sidewalks about town.  These vans should be sold off, so the City of Denver could at least recover some of our money back for these vehicles.</p>

                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">No, I would return the raises and ask that the City of Denver to apply those funds to further expand the community outreach team that I would have in place, so that I can better serve and more quickly respond to the residents of District 7.  </p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Of course there is always more that can be done.  However, let me first say that taking on the job of being a police officer is a dangerous and often thankless position.  We owe most police officers a huge debt of gratitude for doing work that most of us would not do.  That said, it appears that most of the reforms that Chief White has implemented have been internal to the Denver Police force.  What I would certainly recommend to Chief White is that he also place a greater emphasis on community outreach.  Clearly there is tremendous amount of distrust that some parts of our community have with the DPD.  Hence, I would certainly advocate that Chief White conduct a few town hall meetings (with Mayor Hancock right there as well)… so that members of the community have more of an opportunity to vent their frustrations and concerns.  I believe through greater understanding and interaction between the police and the general public, tensions between the community and the police will begin to subside.  </p>

                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">Considering that the current City Council just paid out $6 million dollars to Marvin Booker’s family (in the Booker family’s wrongful death / excessive force case against the City of Denver), the City Council has to take a lead role in fixing problems in jail policies and procedures.  I personally would welcome the opportunity to lead a City Council task force that would be charged with addressing this issue.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Candidly, I had originally opposed this plan because I thought it involved new taxes.  However this program primarily relies on extending out hotel and rental car taxes that are already in effect.  Let’s face it, the area over by the Stock Show is in effect the gateway area to Denver and has been neglected for far too long.  That said, I would certainly recommend that the City of Denver auction off partnership rights to the commercial portion of this development (so that Denver could share the financial and development risk with at least one other partner).  </p>

                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">While I think Mayor Hancock has been a good ambassador for the City of Denver, I would definitely like to see Mayor Hancock take more of a lead role in community outreach (i.e. conducting town hall meetings) to further understand and reduce tensions between the police department and some parts of the Denver community.  I believe it’s the Mayor (and not just Chief White) who needs to be front and center on reducing tensions between DPD and the Denver community.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">As a small business owner, I certainly do not have an organized labor mindset.  That said, if a majority of Denver’s Civil Service Employees wanted to organize, that’s something that they definitely have the right to do.  And if they chose to do so, I would support them in that effort.  However, in order for a Collective Bargaining Agreement to be enacted for Denver’s Civil Service employees, that would first have to be approved by Denver voters, in order to amend the Denver City Charter.</p>

                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">As the dad of a smart and happy third grader, (whom I am very proud of!), my greatest regulatory concern revolves around edible marijuana.  “Edibles” now make up over 45% of all the legal marijuana sold in Colorado.  While new regulations went into effect on January 1st (to better regulate dosing and provide more childproof packaging), I am still very concerned about pot products that still look like candy, as well as THC infused drinks, being ingested by our kids.  It’s my intent on City Council to bring together parents, schools and leaders in the Colorado Pot industry to discuss ways that we can and should go further, to even better ensure that our kids are protected from accidental ingestion of pot products.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No.  I agree with current restrictions that prohibit the public consumption of marijuana, which are now in effect.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would support a smoking ban along the 16th Street Mall.  However, I do NOT believe in allocating Denver Police resources in order to enforce such a ban.  That said, I do believe that through some design and strategy changes, that the 16th Street Mall can and should become much more family and kid friendly.  A greater influx of families and kids will also likely have the effect of attracting more of a healthy / non-smoking crowd to the 16th Street Mall.  I plan to discuss more of my 16th Street Mall strategy recommendations with the Downtown Denver Partner when I meet with them on April 10th.  Pertaining to the other question above, I do not currently support a ban on smoking in Denver’s city parks.</p>

                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">In the Denver City Budget, I would personally like to see some additional funding provided to Denver Public Schools, Denver public works programs and Denver Parks and Recreation.  Just as an example, K-12 education is currently just allocated ONE-TENTH of 1 percent of the total city budget.</p>
                <p class="answer">High performing public schools are a key driver of growth of great neighborhoods.  Hence even just a small reallocation of dollars to one-half of 1 percent of the City of Denver Budget for DPS schools, would enable schools to hire a quite a few more teachers.  This would enable DPS to significantly reduce student to teacher ratios, which has been shown to have a tremendous impact on the quality our kids’ education.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Mathews "Mateos" Alvarez</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">My passion for District 7, and all of Denver, is what drives me to seek this City Council seat. As a Colorado native, I have spent over 15 years working to improve Denver for everyone. My career in the nonprofit sector has focused on building trust between residents and police, giving parents a voice in public education, and making sure everyone has access to job opportunities. I would like to put my experience to work for the people of District 7.</p>

                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">District 7 is a diverse and growing area. Rapid growth is the number one issue we face right now. This impacts the quality of life of Denverites with increased traffic congestion and access to housing.  I believe City Council needs to do more to promote alternative modes of transportation in the inner city so that we can reduce the number of cars.  We need more protected bike lanes, inner city public transportation between major light rail hubs to get Denverites around the city quickly.  City Council also needs to build up its housing portfolio with more low and middle income housing units to meet the demands of a growing city.  There will need to be more public and private partnerships to raise the revenue for building more housing units in Denver, but I also think non profit organizations who work with fixed income communities need to be part of the conversation as well.  When thinking about growth, connectivity between the east and west sides of the district has to be a priority. With I-25 and the Platte River dividing the district, physically connecting the neighborhoods with bridges, sidewalks, bike lanes and roads, is a top priority. As a bi-lingual candidate, I’ll focus on building unity across the district and finding win-win solutions that will help all families thrive. </p>

                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">A second issue that needs to be addressed is the issue of building trust between the Denver Police Department and communities of color who feel too many fatal shootings of unarmed individuals have taken place. I support Denver City Council's leadership on this issue and their unanimous passing of Council Bill 67 which strengthens the Independent Monitor's investigatory authority.  Although this new council bill is only a small step in the right direction, I will be a strong voice on city council that will advocate for increased authority of the Independent Monitor's Office. Crime affects all Denverites. But if we want safety, we must build trust: from neighbor to neighbor, residents to police, and police to city leadership.  As a bi-lingual and bi-cultural candidate, if elected, I will serve as an active liaison between our city's Police Department and District 7 residents to facilitate a conversation about how we can all be allies in building the kind of city we all want to live in.</p>
                <p class="answer">A City is only as good as the services it provides its citizens. A third priority as councilmember will be to ensure that District 7's infrastructure is improved and maintained. There are countless roads in the western side of the district that need immediate repair and attention. There are sidewalks that simply end. Like any family household, our city has to stretch our budget. I'll work to find cost-effective ways to address snow removal, trash and recycling and road repairs, while ensuring transparency for every dollar spent.  We have to make sure that resources are spent evenly throughout the city and district. Everyone deserves safe roads to take them to work, recreation centers and parks to say fit and build community, and libraries to ignite learning. Whether I'm fighting for transparency in spending or pushing for expanded series for all of District 7, I'll be fighting for your quality of life.</p>

                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">Commercial development has to be smart and sustainable, with parking and transportation included in planning from the beginning. "In the ground" parking garages, underneath new development, needs to be included with multi-unit developments. Additionally, multi-use development, with businesses sharing space with residential units, can also keep communities working where they live, which can decrease congestion and parking. As previously mentioned, I believe City Council needs to do more to promote alternative modes of transportation in the inner city so that we can reduce the number of cars.  We need more protected bike lanes, inner city public transportation between major light rail hubs to get Denverites around the city quickly.  </p>

                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe City Council should play a major role in addressing homelessness in Denver.  I would like to continue the City partnerships set up by Mayor Hickenlooper with the Downtown Denver Partnership and BID.  These partnerships have helped fund the St. Francis Center and the Denver's Road Home, among other groups addressing homelessness in Denver.  I believe we all have a stake in ending homelessness in Denver, and it is very important that our city come together to address homelessness that includes non-profits, businesses and our city government.  One important thing I will advocate for as a City Councilmember is for City Council to review the city plan to address homelessness that was written about 10 years ago.  I would like to make sure we come up with an updated and revised plan that will meet the new demands of homelessness that we face today. </p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe this is a situation that calls for balance. I understand the City's need for the revenue that the red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement offer, but we have to balance out the inconvenience of getting fined for speeding, with offering alternative transportation choices for getting around the city.  If residents feel they have alternative choices, getting a fine now and then is easier to swallow.</p>

                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe in creating a yearly budget that addresses all revenue and expenses annually. If the budget cannot be met, then all expenditures, including salaries, need to be on the table.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">Chief White's reforms have been a great start.  However, there is always more that can be done to improve safety and the independent monitoring of our police department.</p>

                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">More needs to be done to increase inmate safety in the downtown jail. I support the new law of keeping video surveillance footage for 5 years, versus 30 days, to corroborate complaints that are filed after an inmate is released. I also support increasing the Independent Monitors Office oversight authority.</p>

                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">The National Western Stock show is part of our western culture and heritage and is a treasure that Denver needs to protect and invest in. Yes. I think this plan is a good idea.  The City Council voted unanimously to approve the National Western Complex expansion plan and Denver voters will decide the outcome this November.  The economic impact of the National Western Stock show currently is over $100 Million dollars per year. The estimates for the increased economic impact, after the expansion, is upwards of $200 Million per year. The expansion and investment will also enhance the surrounding areas of Globeville and Elyria Swansea, which are also in need of improvement. Although the governance structure needs to be finalized, the other institutional partners (Colorado State University, Denver Museum of Nature and Science, and History Colorado) provide strength and resilience to the $856 Million dollar master plan. The vision is indeed grand, but once it opens in 2025 and the year-round activities and revenue begin to come in, we will quickly celebrate this investment as a city.</p>
                <p class="answer">I think the city can also increase revenue by taxing and regulating short term residential lodging.</p>

                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">I do not know Mayor Hancock personally. I only know of his record as Mayor as a resident of Denver. I think he has done a good job managing our city. Because I do not know him personally, I cannot speak to his weaknesses.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">I support collective bargaining rights for civil service employees. As a Councilmember I would also address this issue by leveraging our City Government to promote and follow “Prevailing Wage”, “Public Labor Agreements”, and “Best Value Employment Metrics” that our city has used in the past.  These three tools, if leveraged correctly, allow workers who are in a Union to set the bar higher for wages, benefits, etc. for all workers (non-Union included) in our City. My job will be to promote the implementation of these three tools as often as possible, and where it makes sense, so that both Union and non-Union workers benefit.</p>

                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">For not having a road map, I think the roll out of the recreational marijuana industry oversight and regulation has gone well. I commend the City Council and Mayor on their leadership to date. I support extending the hours of operation of Denver Dispensaries, to compete with neighboring cities and increase tax revenue. I feel the moratorium on new licenses should be lifted after January 1, 2016.  I think it was wise for Denver City Council to put in a moratorium at the beginning, when the marijuana industry was a new endeavor for the city.  However, both Denver City Government and the marijuana industry have done a great job starting up and regulating a new industry.  I feel the city and county of Denver is in a place where they can lift the license moratorium and make sure all new applicants go through a rigorous process in order to get a license.  However, maintaining and increasing compliance, oversight and enforcement of the current laws are also critical. As a father of 2 daughters, I cannot stress the importance of ensuring that children do not have access to marijuana products. Drivers under the influence need to be prosecuted, as do out of state vendors.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">No.</p>

                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would support an ordinance that bans tobacco products on 16th Street Mall or city parks.  Tobacco is a public health concern and our City should not promote tobacco use in public places like 16th Street Mall.  I believe a ban will also attract more tourists and residents alike who want a healthy, smoke free environment when visiting our city! For smokers, vapor cigarettes offer a safe alternative to second hand smoke.</p>

                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that the city of Denver's budget priorities have been thoughtfully crafted and implemented to date.</p>

                <h3 class="name">Aaron Greco</h3>
                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I’m running for City Council because I want my daughter, Rosemary, and her peers to grow up in a diverse, sustainable, and dynamic city. The City Council plays an important role in shaping Denver’s neighborhoods into vibrant areas with multimodal transportation access, universally accessible parks and recreation, thriving artistic and cultural resources, and bustling local business districts. I want to put my diverse experience in collaborating with communities across the state at every level of government to work for the benefit of all of Denver’s citizens.</p>
                <p>As an aide to two U.S. Representatives from Colorado – Ed Perlmutter & John Salazar – I’ve worked across the state and in Washington to encourage partnerships, unify community voices, and develop policies to increase investments in public infrastructure, while preserving our most precious resources. Today, as a transportation professional, I work with Colorado communities to develop bicycle and pedestrian projects, road and bridge projects, and create greater access to a more robust public transit system.</p>
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Like most working families, young professionals, and millennials in Council District 7, our family is faced with the challenge of rising home prices and cost of living in Denver. We never thought we’d face the possibility of being priced out of our neighborhood – my wife, Tessa, and I both have great jobs – but with challenges like student loan debt, the rising cost of day care, and a crisis with housing affordability in Denver, families just like ours are looking at other options.</p>
                <p>The next City Council has the opportunity to make Denver great for generations to come. To ensure that Denver’s students, professionals, and seniors can continue living in in the city we love, we must tackle a variety of issues with forward-thinking and fiscally responsible policies. As a member of the City Council, I’ll collaborate with my colleagues and the administration to grow the supply and diversity of affordable and attainable housing options in Denver while maintaining the character of our unique neighborhoods. That means taking carefully considered action to encourage responsible density and an interconnected, multimodal transportation system that minimizes the additional strain on our congested roadways.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">District 7 has unique challenges with an interstate, a river, and several North-South arterials dividing communities. Neighborhoods like Ruby Hill and Athmar Park are in close proximity to transit hubs, but have no easy way to connect with those hubs outside of an automobile. Neighborhoods like Platt Park, Baker, West Wash Park, and Overland can’t access the South Platte River Trail safely. Any new developments along the South Platte corridor must include incentives for connectivity upgrades and investments. This can be done through a variety of means. We need a leader who will promote partnerships between multiple government jurisdictions and the private sector to achieve greater multimodal connectivity in Council District 7.</p>
                <p>Transit-oriented, multi-use density has to be promoted in areas like the former Gates Factory location, the Shattuck superfund site, the former RTD bus barn location, and other areas adjacent to light rail. These kinds of developments have the least impact on parking and congestion and are largely located in former industrial or light-industrial areas. In order to accommodate growth responsibly we’ll need to promote these areas for redevelopment.</p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">We are not going to be able to build enough streets and parking to get out from under congestion, let alone the increased traffic volumes that come with growth. We also can’t pull up a drawbridge and ask people to stay away from our city. Denver is inclusive and open, and it should stay that way. First, we have to maintain the transportation system that we have, which is no small feat. Corridors like Alameda west of I-25 are poorly maintained. This is partially because older infrastructure is more expensive to maintain and there are less partnership opportunities. Second, we have to make critical investments in providing multimodal options outside of the automobile. In the coming decades, it will ideally be more efficient to hop on a circulator bus, a train, a bicycle, or sidewalk than it will be to fight congestion in our cars.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">I would not have supported the camping ban as passed in 2012. Denver still lacks proper services and shelter space, although I applaud steps taken through Denver’s Road Home and other programs supported by the Mayor to address these needs. Giving someone seeking shelter a criminal record only makes the problem worse. Supporting our most vulnerable populations with basic services is a core function of government. I will explore the use of social impact bonds and other available financing methods to deliver the housing, addiction treatment, counseling, and training services that will bring Denver’s indigent population out of the cold. This will reduce expenditures on emergency room treatment and incarceration and save taxpayer money in the long run.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">As a transportation policy professional for CDOT, I know all too well how dangerous speeding is. For the safety of motorists, pedestrians, and workers, I support photo radar in work zones and school zones only. I won’t support any expansion of photo radar and won’t support expansion of red light cameras unless a compelling need can be demonstrated. I do believe that red light cameras are an enticement for revenue by some, but I disregard any argument made in favor of expansion related to revenue alone.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">Asking anyone to consider the merits of their paycheck in an unbiased way is impossible. A new system of automatic pay review needs to be implemented. The Career Services Authority Board, or another independent entity, should examine raises for council members and the mayor in the same way it does other city employees.</p>
                <p>I’m running for a job that will pay an eventual annual salary of $91,915. I will give a significant amount to charities that exist inside District 7, and I won’t vote for any pay increase for council members unless unbiased checks are placed on the process.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">I have concerns about some of Chief White’s reform measures like the “team approach”. Many rank-and-file cops feel that response time is delayed and safety may be jeopardized. I was incredibly impressed, however, with the implementation of body cameras, although I think work is needed to ensure that the system works properly.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">There are a number of measures we can explore to address issues at the jail that have resulted in a lack of safety for both inmates and officers. Whether flaws exist in jail design, staffing levels, training, or administration, reforms need to be made. If safety can be promoted through reconfiguration or redesign of parts of the jail, I’ll be the first one to make those recommendations, no matter the cost. I’m not interested in saving a dollar to the detriment of public safety. Period.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes. The renovated and expanded National Western will be a showcase that will bring visitors from across Colorado, the United States, and the world. In a city with more than enough demand on its scarce tax dollars, I think it’s justifiable that the very people who come to enjoy the National Western shoulder some of the burden of paying to build it. As a newly elected councilperson, however, I’d like to at least examine other uses for extended lodging tax revenues.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that Mayor Hancock’s management style is very effective. For a mayor with as much authority as Denver’s, the quality of cabinet-level mayoral appointees is critical to implementing public priorities. Having spoken with many of Denver’s staff, I know that Mayor Hancock’s deputies enjoy working for him and are given what they need to succeed. I believe he has recruited and retained a high-caliber cabinet that looks like Denver and shares our values. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to work closely with him and his administration.</p>
                <p>I’ve been pleased with some progress in his public acceptance of the cannabis industry but feel there is still some room for improvement. My hope is that he’ll be open to many of the ideas the upcoming council must consider regarding the differences between public and private consumption and extending retail hours of operation.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">Collective bargaining is a legal and fundamental human right. Municipal Employees should have access to collective bargaining if they are united behind the desire to do so.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">We still have a long way to go before Denver and Colorado become the model for legalization across the U.S. That said, we’re off to a good start. We need policies that yield a safe and consistent product for consumers, a healthy business environment for producers, and an end to what remains of the black market. I support the exploration of a plant count ordinance and greater restrictions and monitoring of growing co-ops. Additionally, better coordination between city departments is needed to simplify regulatory compliance.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">I believe that the overwhelming number of voters who supported Amendment 64 were sold on a straightforward proposition: marijuana should be regulated like alcohol. I think residents and visitors in Denver should be allowed to consume marijuana in some kind of accommodation that complies with indoor clean air rules and regulations. There’s simply no use in allowing consumption by out-of-state residents without a legal option for them to do so.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Before outright bans are even considered, better management and enforcement policies should be put in place. My concern is that smoking bans are sometimes used to address problems other than the effects of second-hand smoke.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">Greater investments in Community Planning and Development and the Office of Economic Development are needed to foster a robust planning process and accommodate Denver’s unprecedented growth. A number of transportation investments should be made inside of District 7 including bike and pedestrian infrastructure spanning the South Platte River and a dedicated bike lane on Broadway.</p>
                <p>My candidacy for Denver City Council is motivated by a desire to plan a city that that is inclusive, vibrant, safe and navigable. Any budget priorities will reflect these values.</p>

                <p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am running for Denver City Council because I love this city and I care deeply about the future of our city and my community. As a father of two young boys, I want them to grow up in a vibrant community, a safe community and a city that will embrace their full potential. Just like my family, I want every single family in our community to experience the Denver Dream, that regardless of where you grew up, you can accomplish anything.</p>                    	
                <p>As a small business owner, I am passionate about creating an economically vibrant community, one that offers sustainable jobs and for small businesses to grow and flourish. I want to create a safe neighborhood where families can raises their children and for senior to have a place to enjoy their grandchildren. I am passionate about connecting our neighborhoods so that we can work together in order to create world class public schools, state of the art recreation centers, family friendly parks, and healthy community options for our families.</p> 
                <p>I strongly feel that local government should be easily accessible to its residents and responsive to our community’s needs. As Councilman, I will have an open door policy and continue meeting families where they are. We’ll make it easy them to communicate with our office and simply for my office to connect with them.</p>
                <p>I believe together we can accomplish anything and I have so many hopes and dreams for our community. We live in the fastest growing neighborhood in Denver, the most diverse neighborhood in Denver and with the airport in our district, it is the economic engine in the West. But our work is never done alone, that’s why I’ll need your help to accomplish our goals.</p> 
                <p>I hope you will join me and making Denver an even better city than the one we moved to, then the one we grew up in, then the one we started our businesses in and the one we raised our families in.</p>
                <p>Let’s do this together, for the future of our community, depends on all of us.</p></p>                 
                <p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                <p class="answer">Public Safety - In order to have a community that businesses, potential homeowners, and world class and state of the art schools are willing to invest in, we must have a community that is safe for everyone. I will work closely with our police department, community leaders and colleagues to do all we can to ensure the public safety in our district.</p>
                <p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                <p class="answer">1. Transportation - With a fast growing community such as the one we live in, you must have a solid transportation plan for families and our seniors. We also have to ensure that families can travel in and out of the district in a fluid manner. The roads on 56th and Tower, 56th and Dunkirk, and Tower and 40th are not conducive to our growth and we must address is now!</p>
                <p>2. We must address the lack of grocery options in our neighborhood. Our community is literally feeling this and with limited options in our community, we must address this problem now!</p></p>
                <p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                <p class="answer">First, one must have an understanding of traffic engineering and how traffic planning is an integral part of urban development. Simply adding lanes and more streets does not ease congestion. In fact, it make it worse. The Down-Thomas paradox, commonly known by the triple convergence theory, states that more driving options actually induce demand. As such, it is imperative that Denver has sufficient public transportation options. This means Bus Rapid Transit, Light Rail Transit, and greater use of Transportation Oriented Development.</p>   
                <p>The goal is to not make driving easier and cheaper, or make it faster to get from A to B; our goal on city council should be to build successful communities so that A and B are located closer together. Yes, this is a radical paradigm shift that will result in the investment in and development of, our local communities. In other words the way to solve traffic congestion in Denver is with land use planning not simply traffic engineering. This falls within the realm of city council, which means that my responsibility as your next council representative for District 11 will be to build vibrant communities that are walkable and accessible. It is not under we understand the fundamental problem that we can begin to assign innovative solutions.</p></p>
                <p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                <p class="answer">We really have to strike a balance here. We need to see that the "Social Impact Bond" to provide services and housing for the homeless is followed through. We should also ensure that our police officers are trained to better deal with the homeless. </p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am open to this as long as safety is always the priority for Denver residents.</p>
                <p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                <p class="answer">What interests me, is that city council, according to city ordinance, must address this issue every 4 years. It was approved by the majority of council this year and I really see no reason to return the raise.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                <p class="answer">I applaud him for listen to the community and offering some solutions that can help resolve this challenge we are having in Denver. The jury is still out on this but I think he's working hard to implement reforms needed.</p>
                <p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                <p class="answer">This has been a real black eye for our city but I firmly believe that Safety Director Stephanie O'Malley, the Chief of Police and Sheriff are working hard to address this concern and meeting with a great number of stakeholders throughout the city has been critical. The council should continue to give teeth to the independent monitor, like they did this past month. Our role is to not just approve settlements, in fact since 2012 we've settled a little over $10 million due to allegations of excessive force by the police and deputies. We must work diligently to fix this problem together.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think the city's plan to keep the National Western Center in Denver is a viable one; although, I would have to look further into it, I currently seen no reason to oppose it.</p>
                <p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Mayor has ran the city now for almost 4 years. His works will and have spoken for itself and the voters will judge him off that on May 5th. I am not running for city council to be for or against our mayor but I am running to improve the lives of working families and businesses in District 11.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                <p class="answer">"Collective bargaining is an opportunity to for a constructive dialogue to address working conditions and terms of employment. I genuinely believe in a balanced approach. That we can continue to create sustainable jobs but also respectable conversations with and for employees.</p>
                <p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                <p class="answer">I think the regulations are working for the most part; I would like for us to really get a handle on the inspections and compliance portion of the regulation. We should consider a standardized checklist so we can avoid potential duplicate inspections at the same location for multiple licenses. It’s important that we always ensure the public of its safety but I also want to make sure this isn’t too costly for the city and business.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                <p class="answer">We should treat this the same way we treat alcohol. We don't not allow public consumption of alcohol so we should do the same for marijuana.</p>
                <p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                <p class="answer">Not sure about Parks but on the mall there might be a possibility because of it's uniqueness. Having attended a great number of council committee hearings and full council meetings, I know that city council is currently looking at ways to address this.</p>
                <p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
                <p class="answer">I plan to look at our budget line item by line item and assess what those priorities are and what programs we might need to adjust. I plan on being hands on when it comes to our budget.</p>
