                <ul>
                    <li class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Because I believe we need people on City Council who are going to be fiscally responsible and treat taxpayer dollars as sacred and not their own private slush fund.</li>                
                	<li class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Housing is becoming very unaffordable in Denver right now and I would get rid of unnecessary land use regulations that are prohibiting more affordable housing units from being built.</li>
                    <li class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</li>
                    <li class="answer"><p>I would work on getting our roads paved so that they aren't destroying our cars and I would make sure Denver parks and open spaces are preserved so that Denver residents can maintain their quality of life.</li>
                    <li class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I would make sure the proper infrastructure is in place to handle new developments before deciding to move forward on any given project. What's the use of building a gas station it's going to take twenty minutes to turn into from an intersection?</li>
                    <li class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</li>
                    <li class="answer">People who are homeless need homes before they need anything else. Support services are just that, they don't provide homes for the homeless, nor does banning panhandling and public camping.</li>
                    <li class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</li>
                    <li class="answer">No I absolutely do not. Not as a revenue generator for a City Council that can't balance a budget no matter how much money they collect.</li>
                    <li class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I would return raises. They was a very immoral decision on the part of every council member who voted for that. </li>
                    <li class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</li>
                    <li class="answer">No they haven't worked, and the only thing that needs to be done is for everyone including law enforcement officers is to uphold their oath to serve and protect, not harass and neglect.</li>
                    <li class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</li>
                    <li class="answer">In the Charter, City Council is responsible for oversight of the jail and should therefore do it's job of overseeing.</li>
                    <li class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</li>
                    <li class="answer">As of now yes. I don't know of a better alternative and it's something that needs to be done.</li>
                    <li class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</li>
                    <li class="answer">His greatest strength is that he is an incumbent with a lot of money. His greatest weakness is that a lot people see him as a puppet for developers.</li>
                    <li class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</li>
                    <li class="answer">No they shouldn't. Our current employment system is just fine.</li>
                    <li class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</li>
                    <li class="answer">No they're not. The high sales tax has created an even bigger black market than before. I would support repealing the ordinance that made recreational pot shops legal in Denver.</li>
                    <li class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</li>
                    <li class="answer">No. It should be banned.</li>
                    <li class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Yes. That is a place where families take their children and we should not allow our babies to inhale tobacco smoke whether indoors or outdoors.</li>
                    <li class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I would look into privatizing so that much needed services would be provided without costing taxpayers too much.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Because I love this city and see it getting away from its values and what has made it great as we deal with this incredible transition and growth period.  I will provide an incredibly different perspective than any of our current City Council members as I have more business experience than all of them combined and more philanthropic experience than any one of them that doesn't revolve around a photo opportunity.  I couldn't care less for special interests, the status quo or assuming that just because we've done something in the past that it needs to continue being done that way.  We are rapidly evolving as a city and need folks who think truly progressively, something our current Council appears incapable of.  I went from homeless 7 years ago to having seven local businesses that employ about 100 people, are community-driven to the max and engage in and understand the problems of the people we surround ourselves with.  I'm a real person.</li>

                	<li class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Affordable housing in our city's core because of the free pass our current City Council and Mayor have given developers to run amok and ignore this issue without repercussion.  This issue creates many of the others plaguing our city as they relate to far fewer purchasable properties that keep people from home ownership, public transportation inadequacies and too many cars on the road as more and more people are required to move into the suburbs and make their way into the city each day, stagnant wages and a loss of many artistic and creative opportunities in our city core that can't afford to exist any more. </li>
                    <li class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</li>
                    <li class="answer"><p>Access for children to creative, artistic, thought-based and entrepreneurial services after school.  While Mayor Hancock made recreational centers available for free to DPS students, physical activity isn't going to provide our youth an opportunity to excel in life and understand that there are bigger and better things out there for them.  Our public schools are in shambles with an outdated curriculum and lack of funding to support the great teachers we have within them.  As hard as we will need to work to fix that issue, and we will try, I think we can provide other services to kids in these other disciplines to engage them constructively and do so with many of our existing private foundations, organizations and entities and without costing the city much, if anything.  Obviously to get kids to these services will require transportation, something lacking for many low-income families, but I have some great public and private ideas here as well to bridge this gap.</p>
                    <p>While public transportation and our out of control police force are towards the top of my list, I don't just come to the table with solutions for existing issues, but rather solutions for future issues that aren't apparent problems yet, or at least aren't noticed by the general public yet.  We need someone in Council with some foresight and not simply a reactive mindset.  I think establishing the epicenter of our nation's hemp economy in Denver is the most impactful thing we can do as a city right now.  This is an industry that is about to take off in a big way on an international level, will be 100x larger than medical or social cannabis, less controversial than both of those and a foundation for a truly local economy, something I believe is the solution to many of our existing problems locally and nationally.  We are already legally growing hemp in this state, but it hasn't taken off because we don't have the processing facilities available here or anywhere else in the country because of our Federal government's ignorant association with this plant to cannabis.  If we build these processing facilities here in Denver, production of hemp will expand across Colorado and we will create tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of economic development, all of it sitting on the table right now just waiting.  I can and will bring the money in to get this done and have this plan come to fruition during my Council term.  We will then be far less reliant on international and national sources for food, textiles, fuel, construction materials and on and on.  We can create a truly local and self-sufficient community.  Let's be the progressive example and guiding light for hemp as we have for medical and social use cannabis.</p></li>
                    <li class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</li>
                    <li class="answer">By not allowing restaurants and bars to be piled up on one another in our wonderful and eclectic neighborhoods.  As an example, allowing places like Punch Bowl Social to inhabit a neighborhood like Baker on Broadway have done that neighborhood a huge disservice.  I own a business in the neighborhood and know hundreds and hundreds of constituents who work and live the area who agree with me.  Parking is becoming non-existent, crime is up and we've lost the opportunity for more necessary services to go into that space since they opened. Examples like this exist all over the city.  Where is the push for more local and organic markets and non-booze-fueled modes of entertainment that families and the rest of us can enjoy in our neighborhoods?  Why are we being forced to leave our own neighborhoods to be entertained while alcohol and traffic issues continue to erode our community fabric?  Local, neighborhood economies.  It's really that simple.</li>
                    <li class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</li>
                    <li class="answer">To say that homelessness is a crime is an abomination and our current Council and Mayor should be ashamed of themselves for pushing for that definition.  It's a public health issue that needs real solutions at the root of the problem, not some tired attempt to cover it up.  Lack of affordable housing and access to harm reduction services for drug addicts are the two main perpetuators of this problem and the City has done little more than nothing to provide support to correcting this.  They've given developers a free pass to ignore the construction of low-mid-income housing and the ability for people to purchase properties and establish roots in our community.  They've provided nothing in the way of support to harm reduction programs to finally start viewing drug addiction as a public health issue and not a crime.  We are creating our own cycles of homelessness by our failed and archaic policies on these two issues.  I've already pledged to donate half of my Council salary to the Harm Reduction Center and the rest will soon be earmarked for other progressive groups that are working on creating these solutions. If our current elected officials don't feel this is a priority, I will do what I can to tackle it myself, and not vote to give myself the maximum raise as this current Council and both my incumbent competitors just did. </li>
                    <li class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Heck no.  These things are downright criminal and do nothing to improve public safety.</li>
                    <li class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Per my comments above, I have already pledged to donate half of my salary to the Harm Reduction Action Center, with the other half to be given away soon to local and deserving progressives in our community.  Not only did our current Council provide the maximum raise to themselves, they kept that decision out of the hands of Denver voters. Abhorable.  I am running for office as a public service, not to bankroll a comfy lifestyle or to pursue future political aspirations.  A true democracy is driven by people with varied life/business experiences, not career politicians looking to benefit their bottom line.</li>
                    <li class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</li>
                    <li class="answer">While the police force appears to have made strides to increase their levels of compassion and accountability within their ranks, we need to do more.  I think the city would benefit greatly from more peace officers capable of mediating and integrating with our communities and less police officers roaming our city streets.  Don't take this as me saying I want police gone, because that is far from the case.  I just think we use their services in many environments where they don't provide a benefit and we end up wasting taxpayer money and coming across as a militaristic and lacking in compassion. The utilization of peace officers means more jobs, more watchful eyes on the streets, a better relationship with our communities and getting these folks back to being public servants and not instigators of $10+ million gone in lawsuits for police brutality and misuse of power.</li>
                    <li class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I think pushing for sensible reform in drug policy and homelessness would be a great start.  If people aren't thrown in jails for public health issues it becomes harder to abuse them in jails.  Aside from that though, more accountability and less militaristic ideals with all our police and prison staff.  Bad apples need to be removed from the police force and held accountable legally, not given paid time off and a slap on the wrist for gross misuses of power.  It's all about creating a culture shift and that starts with providing examples of very real consequences of action.</li>
                    <li class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I'm not opposed, but I think other options should always be looked at to perhaps supplement this revenue.  This is a massive state and regional benefit and it would seem outsiders should do some chipping in as well.  We're also proposing giving back a large sum of cannabis tax money, much of it earned from tourists.  Why not either repurpose this money or lower those taxes?</li>
                    <li class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</li>
                    <li class="answer">They are one in the same, the fact that he is out of touch.  Unfortunately it makes his strength only an asset for him and a liability for this city.  His isolation and unwillingness to engage in a real way has kept him out of touch with the needs of the communities he should be serving, yet close to developer cronies who are funding his reelection without any true competition to hold him accountable.  I think he's wrong for Denver.</li>
                    <li class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I am not opposed to the discussion of collective bargaining rights for civil service employees.</li>
                    <li class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Of course they are, but they can be better.  We've seen domestic violence and traffic fatalities go down, as well as teen use.  We've seen tax revenue generated to the point that we are talking about giving it back to taxpayers and we've seen more and more studies show that these businesses reduce crime in the areas they inhabit.  The main issue that needs to be addressed is operating hours and extending these from 7pm to 10pm for retail cannabis stores in Denver.  Most municipalities surrounding Denver allow these stores to be open until 10pm, which forces people in Denver to either drive a distance or buy on the black market after 7pm.  All this while alcohol sales are allowed until midnight, a drug that kills 1 in 7 working age Coloradans according to the CDC.  Why not allow our residents similar access to the SAFER alternative?  Let's not forget the economic value being lost here and not just in the millions in tax revenue being shipped outside this city.  With 150-200 cannabis dispensaries in Denver, each with 5-10 employees onsite at any given time, those additional three hours of operation each day are losing this city thousands of labor hours each and every day, for no logical reason.  The sky never fell, folks.</li>
                    <li class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Yes, of course.  The intent of Amendment 64 was to equalize cannabis with alcohol.  The inability of folks to legally consume is creating an epidemic with regard to public consumption tickets being issued and a conundrum for tourists.  It is foolish to tell millions of people around the world that it is legal to purchase cannabis in this state, but not give them an opportunity to legally consume it here.  Hotels are predominantly owned by large chains that disallow it all together.  Boutique hotels have come on board to try and address this issue but haven't made a dent because the Colorado Clean Indoor Air Act greatly limits the number of rooms that can allow smoking.  While I don't believe cannabis cafes are the solution, there needs to be some consideration for incorporating this use into existing venues.  I believe additional restricted licenses should be available to existing bars and venues that designate interior spaces for the vaporizing of cannabis and designated outdoor areas where tobacco smoking is allowed to be used for the combustion of cannabis plant material.  I believe this solution integrates this use into our existing city fabric much more responsibly than cannabis cafes, which segregate these users and perpetuate stereotypes that simply aren't true.</li>
                    <li class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I'm torn on this issue.  I don't believe government should be in control of an issue like this, but also understand the concerns associated with wanting to do it.  I need to speak with all stakeholders (business owners, city officials, residents and tourists) more to make an informed decision.</li>
                    <li class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I really love what Denver has done with their Arts & Venues Department, creating a self-funded entity that is reliant on itself to be efficient with the use of its money and make good decisions with it because the alternative is the inability to function.  More accountability for how money is spent and incorporating a traditional business practices to balancing cash flow would go a long way and reduce the necessity for perpetually rising taxes.  As someone who has more business experience than all folks currently in City Council and our Mayor combined, I have zero reason to believe I can't bring from more sustainable business practices to how we raise and spend our money.</li>

                    <li class="answer"><p>I am running for Denver City Council because I love this city and I care deeply about the future of our city and my community. As a father of two young boys, I want them to grow up in a vibrant community, a safe community and a city that will embrace their full potential. Just like my family, I want every single family in our community to experience the Denver Dream, that regardless of where you grew up, you can accomplish anything.</p>

                    <p>As a small business owner, I am passionate about creating an economically vibrant community, one that offers sustainable jobs and for small businesses to grow and flourish. I want to create a safe neighborhood where families can raises their children and for senior to have a place to enjoy their grandchildren. I am passionate about connecting our neighborhoods so that we can work together in order to create world class public schools, state of the art recreation centers, family friendly parks, and healthy community options for our families.</p> 
                    <p>I strongly feel that local government should be easily accessible to its residents and responsive to our community’s needs. As Councilman, I will have an open door policy and continue meeting families where they are. We’ll make it easy them to communicate with our office and simply for my office to connect with them.</p>
                    <p>I believe together we can accomplish anything and I have so many hopes and dreams for our community. We live in the fastest growing neighborhood in Denver, the most diverse neighborhood in Denver and with the airport in our district, it is the economic engine in the West. But our work is never done alone, that’s why I’ll need your help to accomplish our goals.</p> 
                    <p>I hope you will join me and making Denver an even better city than the one we moved to, then the one we grew up in, then the one we started our businesses in and the one we raised our families in.</p>
                    <p>Let’s do this together, for the future of our community, depends on all of us.</p></li>                 
                    <li class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Public Safety - In order to have a community that businesses, potential homeowners, and world class and state of the art schools are willing to invest in, we must have a community that is safe for everyone. I will work closely with our police department, community leaders and colleagues to do all we can to ensure the public safety in our district.</li>
                    <li class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</li>
                    <li class="answer"><p>1. Transportation - With a fast growing community such as the one we live in, you must have a solid transportation plan for families and our seniors. We also have to ensure that families can travel in and out of the district in a fluid manner. The roads on 56th and Tower, 56th and Dunkirk, and Tower and 40th are not conducive to our growth and we must address is now!</p>
                    <p>2. We must address the lack of grocery options in our neighborhood. Our community is literally feeling this and with limited options in our community, we must address this problem now!</p></li>
                    <li class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</li>
                    <li class="answer"><p>First, one must have an understanding of traffic engineering and how traffic planning is an integral part of urban development. Simply adding lanes and more streets does not ease congestion. In fact, it make it worse. The Down-Thomas paradox, commonly known by the triple convergence theory, states that more driving options actually induce demand. As such, it is imperative that Denver has sufficient public transportation options. This means Bus Rapid Transit, Light Rail Transit, and greater use of Transportation Oriented Development.</p>   
                    <p>The goal is to not make driving easier and cheaper, or make it faster to get from A to B; our goal on city council should be to build successful communities so that A and B are located closer together. Yes, this is a radical paradigm shift that will result in the investment in and development of, our local communities. In other words the way to solve traffic congestion in Denver is with land use planning not simply traffic engineering. This falls within the realm of city council, which means that my responsibility as your next council representative for District 11 will be to build vibrant communities that are walkable and accessible. It is not under we understand the fundamental problem that we can begin to assign innovative solutions.</p></li>
                    <li class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</li>
                    <li class="answer">We really have to strike a balance here. We need to see that the "Social Impact Bond" to provide services and housing for the homeless is followed through. We should also ensure that our police officers are trained to better deal with the homeless. </li>
                    <li class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I am open to this as long as safety is always the priority for Denver residents.</li>
                    <li class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</li>
                    <li class="answer">What interests me, is that city council, according to city ordinance, must address this issue every 4 years. It was approved by the majority of council this year and I really see no reason to return the raise.</li>
                    <li class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I applaud him for listen to the community and offering some solutions that can help resolve this challenge we are having in Denver. The jury is still out on this but I think he's working hard to implement reforms needed.</li>
                    <li class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</li>
                    <li class="answer">This has been a real black eye for our city but I firmly believe that Safety Director Stephanie O'Malley, the Chief of Police and Sheriff are working hard to address this concern and meeting with a great number of stakeholders throughout the city has been critical. The council should continue to give teeth to the independent monitor, like they did this past month. Our role is to not just approve settlements, in fact since 2012 we've settled a little over $10 million due to allegations of excessive force by the police and deputies. We must work diligently to fix this problem together.</li>
                    <li class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I think the city's plan to keep the National Western Center in Denver is a viable one; although, I would have to look further into it, I currently seen no reason to oppose it.</li>
                    <li class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</li>
                    <li class="answer">The Mayor has ran the city now for almost 4 years. His works will and have spoken for itself and the voters will judge him off that on May 5th. I am not running for city council to be for or against our mayor but I am running to improve the lives of working families and businesses in District 11.</li>
                    <li class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</li>
                    <li class="answer">"Collective bargaining is an opportunity to for a constructive dialogue to address working conditions and terms of employment. I genuinely believe in a balanced approach. That we can continue to create sustainable jobs but also respectable conversations with and for employees.</li>
                    <li class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I think the regulations are working for the most part; I would like for us to really get a handle on the inspections and compliance portion of the regulation. We should consider a standardized checklist so we can avoid potential duplicate inspections at the same location for multiple licenses. It’s important that we always ensure the public of its safety but I also want to make sure this isn’t too costly for the city and business.</li>
                    <li class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</li>
                    <li class="answer">We should treat this the same way we treat alcohol. We don't not allow public consumption of alcohol so we should do the same for marijuana.</li>
                    <li class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Not sure about Parks but on the mall there might be a possibility because of it's uniqueness. Having attended a great number of council committee hearings and full council meetings, I know that city council is currently looking at ways to address this.</li>
                    <li class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</li>
                    <li class="answer">I plan to look at our budget line item by line item and assess what those priorities are and what programs we might need to adjust. I plan on being hands on when it comes to our budget.</li>
