	<p class="question">Why are you running for City Council?</p>
	<p class="answer">I’m running for City Council because I want my daughter, Rosemary, and her peers to grow up in a diverse, sustainable, and dynamic city. The City Council plays an important role in shaping Denver’s neighborhoods into vibrant areas with multimodal transportation access, universally accessible parks and recreation, thriving artistic and cultural resources, and bustling local business districts. I want to put my diverse experience in collaborating with communities across the state at every level of government to work for the benefit of all of Denver’s citizens.</p>
	<p>As an aide to two U.S. Representatives from Colorado – Ed Perlmutter & John Salazar – I’ve worked across the state and in Washington to encourage partnerships, unify community voices, and develop policies to increase investments in public infrastructure, while preserving our most precious resources. Today, as a transportation professional, I work with Colorado communities to develop bicycle and pedestrian projects, road and bridge projects, and create greater access to a more robust public transit system.</p>

	<p class="question">What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
	<p class="answer">Like most working families, young professionals, and millennials in Council District 7, our family is faced with the challenge of rising home prices and cost of living in Denver. We never thought we’d face the possibility of being priced out of our neighborhood – my wife, Tessa, and I both have great jobs – but with challenges like student loan debt, the rising cost of day care, and a crisis with housing affordability in Denver, families just like ours are looking at other options.</p>
	<p>The next City Council has the opportunity to make Denver great for generations to come. To ensure that Denver’s students, professionals, and seniors can continue living in in the city we love, we must tackle a variety of issues with forward-thinking and fiscally responsible policies. As a member of the City Council, I’ll collaborate with my colleagues and the administration to grow the supply and diversity of affordable and attainable housing options in Denver while maintaining the character of our unique neighborhoods. That means taking carefully considered action to encourage responsible density and an interconnected, multimodal transportation system that minimizes the additional strain on our congested roadways.</p>
	<p class="question">Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
	<p class="answer">District 7 has unique challenges with an interstate, a river, and several North-South arterials dividing communities. Neighborhoods like Ruby Hill and Athmar Park are in close proximity to transit hubs, but have no easy way to connect with those hubs outside of an automobile. Neighborhoods like Platt Park, Baker, West Wash Park, and Overland can’t access the South Platte River Trail safely. Any new developments along the South Platte corridor must include incentives for connectivity upgrades and investments. This can be done through a variety of means. We need a leader who will promote partnerships between multiple government jurisdictions and the private sector to achieve greater multimodal connectivity in Council District 7.</p>
	<p>Transit-oriented, multi-use density has to be promoted in areas like the former Gates Factory location, the Shattuck superfund site, the former RTD bus barn location, and other areas adjacent to light rail. These kinds of developments have the least impact on parking and congestion and are largely located in former industrial or light-industrial areas. In order to accommodate growth responsibly we’ll need to promote these areas for redevelopment.</p>
	<p class="question">As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
	<p class="answer">We are not going to be able to build enough streets and parking to get out from under congestion, let alone the increased traffic volumes that come with growth. We also can’t pull up a drawbridge and ask people to stay away from our city. Denver is inclusive and open, and it should stay that way. First, we have to maintain the transportation system that we have, which is no small feat. Corridors like Alameda west of I-25 are poorly maintained. This is partially because older infrastructure is more expensive to maintain and there are less partnership opportunities. Second, we have to make critical investments in providing multimodal options outside of the automobile. In the coming decades, it will ideally be more efficient to hop on a circulator bus, a train, a bicycle, or sidewalk than it will be to fight congestion in our cars.</p>
	<p class="question">Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
	<p class="answer">I would not have supported the camping ban as passed in 2012. Denver still lacks proper services and shelter space, although I applaud steps taken through Denver’s Road Home and other programs supported by the Mayor to address these needs. Giving someone seeking shelter a criminal record only makes the problem worse. Supporting our most vulnerable populations with basic services is a core function of government. I will explore the use of social impact bonds and other available financing methods to deliver the housing, addiction treatment, counseling, and training services that will bring Denver’s indigent population out of the cold. This will reduce expenditures on emergency room treatment and incarceration and save taxpayer money in the long run.</p>
	<p class="question">Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
	<p class="answer">As a transportation policy professional for CDOT, I know all too well how dangerous speeding is. For the safety of motorists, pedestrians, and workers, I support photo radar in work zones and school zones only. I won’t support any expansion of photo radar and won’t support expansion of red light cameras unless a compelling need can be demonstrated. I do believe that red light cameras are an enticement for revenue by some, but I disregard any argument made in favor of expansion related to revenue alone.</p>
	<p class="question">If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
	<p class="answer">Asking anyone to consider the merits of their paycheck in an unbiased way is impossible. A new system of automatic pay review needs to be implemented. The Career Services Authority Board, or another independent entity, should examine raises for council members and the mayor in the same way it does other city employees.</p>
	<p>I’m running for a job that will pay an eventual annual salary of $91,915. I will give a significant amount to charities that exist inside District 7, and I won’t vote for any pay increase for council members unless unbiased checks are placed on the process.</p>
	<p class="question">Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
	<p class="answer">I have concerns about some of Chief White’s reform measures like the “team approach”. Many rank-and-file cops feel that response time is delayed and safety may be jeopardized. I was incredibly impressed, however, with the implementation of body cameras, although I think work is needed to ensure that the system works properly.</p>
	<p class="question">Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
	<p class="answer">There are a number of measures we can explore to address issues at the jail that have resulted in a lack of safety for both inmates and officers. Whether flaws exist in jail design, staffing levels, training, or administration, reforms need to be made. If safety can be promoted through reconfiguration or redesign of parts of the jail, I’ll be the first one to make those recommendations, no matter the cost. I’m not interested in saving a dollar to the detriment of public safety. Period.</p>
	<p class="question">Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
	<p class="answer">Yes. The renovated and expanded National Western will be a showcase that will bring visitors from across Colorado, the United States, and the world. In a city with more than enough demand on its scarce tax dollars, I think it’s justifiable that the very people who come to enjoy the National Western shoulder some of the burden of paying to build it. As a newly elected councilperson, however, I’d like to at least examine other uses for extended lodging tax revenues.</p>
	<p class="question">What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
	<p class="answer">I believe that Mayor Hancock’s management style is very effective. For a mayor with as much authority as Denver’s, the quality of cabinet-level mayoral appointees is critical to implementing public priorities. Having spoken with many of Denver’s staff, I know that Mayor Hancock’s deputies enjoy working for him and are given what they need to succeed. I believe he has recruited and retained a high-caliber cabinet that looks like Denver and shares our values. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to work closely with him and his administration.</p>
  	<p>I’ve been pleased with some progress in his public acceptance of the cannabis industry but feel there is still some room for improvement. My hope is that he’ll be open to many of the ideas the upcoming council must consider regarding the differences between public and private consumption and extending retail hours of operation.</p>
	<p class="question">Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
	<p class="answer">Collective bargaining is a legal and fundamental human right. Municipal Employees should have access to collective bargaining if they are united behind the desire to do so.</p>
	<p class="question">Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
	<p class="answer">We still have a long way to go before Denver and Colorado become the model for legalization across the U.S. That said, we’re off to a good start. We need policies that yield a safe and consistent product for consumers, a healthy business environment for producers, and an end to what remains of the black market. I support the exploration of a plant count ordinance and greater restrictions and monitoring of growing co-ops. Additionally, better coordination between city departments is needed to simplify regulatory compliance.</p>
	<p class="question">Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
	<p class="answer">I believe that the overwhelming number of voters who supported Amendment 64 were sold on a straightforward proposition: marijuana should be regulated like alcohol. I think residents and visitors in Denver should be allowed to consume marijuana in some kind of accommodation that complies with indoor clean air rules and regulations. There’s simply no use in allowing consumption by out-of-state residents without a legal option for them to do so.</p>
	<p class="question">Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
	<p class="answer">Before outright bans are even considered, better management and enforcement policies should be put in place. My concern is that smoking bans are sometimes used to address problems other than the effects of second-hand smoke.</p>
	<p class="question">When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
	<p class="answer">Greater investments in Community Planning and Development and the Office of Economic Development are needed to foster a robust planning process and accommodate Denver’s unprecedented growth. A number of transportation investments should be made inside of District 7 including bike and pedestrian infrastructure spanning the South Platte River and a dedicated bike lane on Broadway.</p>
	<p>My candidacy for Denver City Council is motivated by a desire to plan a city that that is inclusive, vibrant, safe and navigable. Any budget priorities will reflect these values.</p>
